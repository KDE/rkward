Requirements
==================

RKWard requires:
- KDE-libraries and headers (>= 3.x) (http://www.kde.org)
- Qt-libraries and headers (>= 3.x) (http://www.trolltech.com)
- R and headers (http://www.r-project.org)
- PHP with commandline-interface (http://www.php.net)

Compilation
==================

IMPORTANT: You will need to have the R shared library installed. This is typically located in a place like /usr/lib/R/lib/libR.so. Unfortunately, some distributions do not yet ship their R binary with the shared library. In those (rare) cases, you'll have to compile and install R on your own.

Compilation / installation is basically just a

# ./configure
# make
# make install

and in 95% of the cases this should be all you need. Here are some ./configure options you may need to set in the other 5%:

--prefix=/path/to/kde

defaults to 1) $KDEDIR or if that is not set 2) the output of "kde-config --prefix". If you have multiple versions of KDE installed, or need to specify the kde-directory for any other reason, you need to set this option explicitely.

One some systems you might also have to specify your qt (3) directory, passing the commandline-option
--with-qt-dir=/usr/lib/qt3			(or similar)
to configure.

The options
--with-r-home
--with-r-includes
--with-r-share
--with-r-doc
can be used to configure the details of your R installation. Usually these settings should be detected automatically, but if - for instance - R can not find its help files when run from RKWard, you may need to adjust --with-r-doc.


Installation
==================

You _have to_ install RKWard. Otherwise RKWard will be missing important menu-options, may behave strangely, or may not run at all.
As root run:
# make install

Make sure you have set the correct path in ./configure (the --prefix=... option)


Running
==================

For now it's recommended to run RKWard from the command-line for debug-output. For the few available command-line options see

# rkward --help
