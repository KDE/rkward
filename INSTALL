Requirements
==================

RKWard requires:
- KDE-libraries and headers (>= 3.x) (http://www.kde.org)
- Qt-libraries and headers (>= 3.x) (http://www.trolltech.com)
- R and headers (http://www.r-project.org)
- PHP with commandline-interface (http://www.php.net)

Compilation
==================

Compilation / installation is basically just a
# ./configure
# make
# make install

you may need to pass the following options to configure:


--prefix=/path/to/kde

you can determine your kde-directory by looking for some K-Application you know you have installed:

# which kedit

and strip the final /bin of the path (e.g. if which kedit returns /usr/bin/kedit , use /usr ).

for debian use --prefix=/usr


You might also have to specify your qt (3) directory, passing the commandline-option
--with-qt-dir=/usr/lib/qt3			(or similar)
to configure.


Likely you will need to specify the location of the R home directory:
--with-r-home=/path/to/R/home			(default is /usr/local/lib/R)
If you have the standalone version of R installed, you can determine this directory by running:
# R RHOME
for debian use --with-r-home=/usr/lib/R

You will need to have the R shared library installed. The makefiles assumes it to be in $R_HOME/lib/libR.so

Personally, I need the following options for configure (debian sid):
--prefix=/usr --with-r-home=/usr/lib/R


Installation
==================

You _have to_ install RKWard. Otherwise RKWard will be missing important menu-options, may behave strangely, or may not run at all.
As root run:
# make install

Make sure you have set the correct path in ./configure (the --prefix=... option)


Running
==================

For now it's recommended to run RKWard from the command-line for debug-output. There are no useful commandline-options so far.
