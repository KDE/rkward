Requirements
==================

RKWard requires:
- KDE-libraries and headers (>= 3.x) (http://www.kde.org)
- Qt-libraries and headers (>= 3.x) (http://www.trolltech.com)
- R and headers (http://www.r-project.org)
- PHP with commandline-interface (http://www.php.net)

Compilation
==================

Compilation / installation is basically just a
# ./configure
# make
# make install

you may need to pass the following options to configure:


--prefix=/path/to/kde

you can determine your kde-directory by looking for some K-Application you know you have installed:

# which kedit

and strip the final /bin of the path (e.g. if which kedit returns /usr/bin/kedit , use /usr ).

for debian use --prefix=/usr


You might also have to specify your qt (3) directory, passing the commandline-option
--with-qt-dir=/usr/lib/qt3			(or similar)
to configure.


Likely you will need to specify the location of additional header files, especially the R-headers:
--with-extra-includes=/path/to/those/headers

for debian use --with-extra-includes=/usr/lib/R/include


Likewise you'll likely have to specify the location of the R-library (file: libR.so):
--with-extra-libs=/usr/lib/R/bin/ 		(or similar)
for R >= 2.0, the default location seems to be
--with-extra-libs=/usr/lib/R/lib/


Personally, I need the following options for configure:
--prefix=/usr --with-extra-libs=/usr/lib/R/lib/ --with-extra-includes=/usr/lib/R/include --enable-debug=full


Installation
==================

You _have to_ install RKWard. Otherwise you may be missing important menu-options.
As root run:
# make install

Make sure you have set the correct path in ./configure (the --prefix=... option)


Running
==================

For now it's recommended to run RKWard from the command-line for debug-output. There are no useful commandline-options so far.
