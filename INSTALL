Requirements
===================

RKWard requires:
- KDE-libraries and headers (>= 4.0) (http://www.kde.org)
- Qt-libraries and headers (>= 4.3) (http://www.trolltech.com)
- R and headers (http://www.r-project.org)
- PHP with commandline-interface (http://www.php.net)
- CMake (http://cmake.org)


Compilation
===================

IMPORTANT: You will need to have the R shared library installed. This is typically located in a place like /usr/lib/R/lib/libR.so. Unfortunately, some distributions do not yet ship their R binary with the shared library. In those (rare) cases, you'll have to compile and install R on your own with the option --enable-R-shlib.

The recommended way to build from source is:
> mkdir build; cd build
> cmake path_to_rkward_sources [options]	# see below
> make
> sudo make install


CMake options (configuring)
===================

The cmake command offers a number of parameters to control the build process. Some commonly needed are:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
	set the installation base directory. Generally -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` should be correct.
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
	type of build. Useful settings include -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release and -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull

In some cases you may want to set the following options:

-DR_EXECUTABLE
	path to the R executable. You may want to set this, if you have multiple versions of R installed, or R is not in your path. Example: -DR_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/R
-DR_LIBDIR
	directory where R packages should be installed. Generally, this option is only of interest to packagers.
-DR_HOME
	R home directory. Almost certainly this option is not needed.
-DR_INCLUDE
	path to R include files. Almost certainly this option is not needed.

Further generic options are listed on http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables .


Installation
==================

As a last step, you _have to_ run 'make install'. Otherwise RKWard will be missing important menu-options, may behave strangely, or may not run at all.
As root run:
> make install

Make sure you have set the correct path in cmake (the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option).


Running
==================

For now it's recommended to run RKWard from the command-line for debug-output. For the few available command-line options see
