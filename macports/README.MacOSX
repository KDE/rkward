RKWard Mac OSX installation bundle
==================================

This is a bundle of KDE for Mac OSX, R for Mac OSX, and RKWard for Mac OSX, built with MacPorts (http://www.macports.org). The purpose is to make installation of RKWard as easy as possible on Mac OSX.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

NOTE: As of now, this bundle is made available for BETA TESTING purposes. It is the first time the RKWard team releases Mac OSX versions of this software. It is not considered a stable release, but built from the current development sources. In case you run into problems, please give us feedback:
 o https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/rkward/index.php?title=Contact


REQUIREMENTS
============

You need at least Mac OSX 10.7 ("Lion") to install this bundle. It is reported to run on 10.8 ("Mountain Lion") as well.


INSTALLATION
============
To install, simply double click the .dmg, and double click the therein appearing archive as well. An installation dialog should appear and ask you for the device to install to (where you should probably select your system harddrive). The contents of this bundle will be installed to /opt/rkward, and the programs will be available at Applications/RKWard.

NOTE: This bundle will NOT install MacPorts itself. It also doesn't touch the MacPorts default directory, so you should be able to use MacPorts in parallel without problems.


AFTER THE INSTALLATION
======================
Mandatory: RKWard is a KDE program, and KDE needs a service called dbus to run. Therefore, after you installed the bundle image, run these commands *once* in a terminal session:

  sudo launchctl load -w /opt/rkward/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
  launchctl load -w /opt/rkward/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist

Mandatory: Currently, you need to update the MIME type database manually before you can run any KDE applications successfully. To do this, run the following command *once* in the terminal:

  sudo /opt/rkward/bin/update-mime-database -V /opt/rkward/share/mime

Optional: As explained, the bundle installs mostly to /opt/rkward. If you want to launch all newly installed applications directly (e.g., R), you probably want to add this to the PATH environment variable, by adding it to ~/.profile:

  echo "export PATH=/opt/rkward/bin:/opt/rkward/sbin:\$PATH" >> ~/.profile


LOCALIZATION
============
Support for other localizations than english is available for all KDE applications, if the environment variable LANG is set accordingly. To acheive that temporarily for your running session, call the following (example for german):

  launchctl setenv LANG de_DE.UTF-8

To set the variable permanently, you can create or edit the file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist (you need to login again for the changes to take effect):

  1. If it doesn't exist, create the folder:
     mkdir ~/.MacOSX

  2. Open/create the file with a text editor, e.g.:
     nano ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist

  3. If the file is new/empty, paste this to it (change the language string to your needs):
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>LANG</key>
            <string>de_DE.UTF-8</string>
        </dict>
    </plist>
    
    If the file does already exist, only add the above key and string nodes accordingly.


RUNNING RKWARD
==============
Double click the "RKWard" icon in your Applications/RKWard folder.


UPDATES/UNINSTALL
=================
There is no real update for binary bundles yet. That is, you need to uninstall and install the new version. Your personal settings should survive that, as they are sored in your personal directory (including manually installed R packages, if you didn't install them to /opt/rkward). To uninstall:

  1. Pull the "RKWard" folder from Applications to Trash

  2. Remove the directory /opt/rkward:
     sudo rm -rf /opt/rkward

Afterwards, you can install the new bundle. You don't need to repeat the steps outlined in "After the installation" and "Localization".
