AFTER THE INSTALLATION
======================

KDE needs dbus to run. Therefore, after you installed the bundle image, run these commands *once* in a terminal session:

  sudo launchctl load -w /opt/rkward/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
  launchctl load -w /opt/rkward/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist

The bundle installs mostly to /opt/rkward. To launch all newly installed applications directly (e.g., R), you probably want to add this to the PATH environment variable, by adding it to ~/.profile:

  echo "export PATH=/opt/rkward/bin:/opt/rkward/sbin:\$PATH" >> ~/.profile

LOCALIZATION
============

Support for other localizations than english are available for all KDE applications, if the environment variable LANG is set accordingly. To acheive that temporarily for your running session, call the following (example for german):

  launchctl setenv LANG de_DE.UTF-8

To set the variable permanently, you can create or edit the file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist (you need to login again for the changes to take effect):

  1. If it doesn't exist, create the folder:
     mkdir ~/.MacOSX

  2. Open/create the file with a text editor, e.g.:
     nano ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist

  3. If the file is new/empty, paste this to it (change the language string to your needs):
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>LANG</key>
            <string>de_DE.UTF-8</string>
        </dict>
    </plist>
    
    If the file does already exist, only add the above key and string nodes accordingly.

UPDATES/UNINSTALL
=================

There is no real update for binary bundles yet. That is, you need to uninstall and install the new version. Your personal settings should survive that, as they are sored in your personal directory (including manually installed R packages, if you didn't install them to /opt/rkward):

1. pull the "RKWard" folder from Applications to Trash
2. remove the directory /opt/rkward:
   sudo rm -rf /opt/rkward

Afterwards, you can install the new bundle. You don't need to repeat the steps outlined in "After the installation" and "Localization".
