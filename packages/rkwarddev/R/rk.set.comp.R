#' Define the component you're currently working on
#' 
#' This small tool let's you set a component name as kind of "active", which simply
#' means it will be returned by \code{\link[rkwarddev:rk.get.comp]{rk.get.comp}}. This can be
#' used by functions like, e.g., \code{\link[rkwarddev:rk.XML.cbox]{rk.XML.cbox}}, to add text
#' for .rkh pages automatically to the current plugin component.
#' 
#' @param component Character string, name of the component to set. If \code{NULL},
#'    no component will be set as default, and \code{rk.get.comp} will return \code{NULL}
#'    subsequently.
#' @export
