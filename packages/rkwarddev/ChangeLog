ChangeLog for package rkwarddev

changes in version 0.07-4 (2015-10-08)
unreleased:
  - this version is under development
fixed:
  - attribute "max_precision" in <spinbox> was misspelled
  - rk.XML.connect() still handled modifiers for "governor" wrong if it
    wasn't a XiMpLe node
  - also fixed how rk.XML.convert() and rk.XML.switch() were handling
    modifier checking
  - some fixes to the skeleton GUI and demo script
added:
  - new methods plugin2script() to try to translate raw plugin XML into
    working rkwarddev script calls
  - new option "ignore" enables rk.uniqueIDs() to not check nodes for
    duplicates (e.g., <copy>)

changes in version 0.07-3 (2015-06-29)
fixed:
  - rk.JS.header() now produces usable level options
added:
  - new slot "opt.sep" in classes rk.JS.arr and rk.JS.opt, as well as new
    option "opt.sep" in rk.paste.JS(), rk.JS.array() and rk.JS.options(), to
    manipulate the character string separating the previous options from the ones
    defined by these objects

changes in version 0.07-2 (2015-03-14)
fixed:
  - replaced the outdated links to sourceforge with our new KDE URL

changes in version 0.07-1 (2015-03-13)
fixed:
  - rk.XML.optionset() does now allow to re-use objects defined in the same
    function call (i.e., refer to optioncolumns in the logic section)
  - removed arguments "help" and "component" from rk.XML.optionscolumn()
    again, as these are already being documented via the objects they connect to.
  - rk.build.plugin() was still only using the "--no-vignettes" option from R
    < 3
  - rk.XML.pluginmap() malformed label argument names if they referred to
    standrad maneu entries
  - rk.plugin.skeleton() still allowed invalid IDs, fixed the regexp
  - rk.XML.snippets() now also accepts <include> as child node
  - rk.XML.tabbook() returns <insert> nodes as-is, not nested in <tab></tab>
  - rk.JS.scan() now sets "state" as default modifier for checkboxes if
    guess.getter is TRUE
  - rk.XML.connect() handled modifiers too strict if "client" was a string,
    and too liberal when "governor" was
  - join() referenced a wrong object name if "var" was of class rk.JS.arr
  - rk.XML.about() had a malformed error message
  - rk.plugin.component() called XMLAttrs() with too many arguments
  - rk.XML.values() and rk.XML.vars() do now handle all combinations of
    "horiz" and "add.nodes" properly
  - fixed wrong link to rk.plugin.skeleton() in documentation of
    rk.XML.pluginmap()
added:
  - all "help" values can now be a list of character strings or XiMpLe nodes,
    to have more control over the markup
  - added "property" and "duplicates" arguments to rk.XML.valueslot() and
    rk.XML.varslot().
  - rk.XML.pluginmap() now adds a "po_id" attribute to pluginmaps, necessary
    for i18n
  - new attribute "require.defaults" in rk.XML.pluginmap() to add
    rkward::menu and rkward::embedded as requirements
  - new attribute "i18n" added to several XML functions; it takes a list with
    the named arguments "comment" or "context" to either produce an i18n
    comment node or an "i18n_context" attribute
  - new function rk.i18n.comment() to give context for translators
  - new function rk.JS.header() to easily generate JavaScript header code fit
    for i18n
  - rk.JS.doc(), rk.plugin.skeleton() and rk.plugin.component() now use
    rk.JS.header() instead of rk.header(), and also accept its "header.add"
    attribute
  - new function R.comment() to generate JavaScript "comment()" calls
  - first unit tests using the testthat package
  - added documentation to the used S4 classes
  - enhanced rk.XML.values() to also accept "options" and "duplicates", and
    rk.XML.vars() to also accept "duplicates"
  - new argument "var" in rk.paste.JS() to define whether the JS keyword
    "var" should be used or omitted for rk.JS.var objects
  - rk.XML.matrix() now also accepts the arguments "min_rows" and
    "min_columns"
  - <dropdown>, <radio> and <select> have gained "string.quoted" as a valid
    property/modifier
  - new function rk.XML.i18n() to define translatable labels in logic sections
  - new function rk.rkh.label() for extracting labels from plugin elements
changed:
  - function i18n() was changed to be used in JavaScript generation only;
    this breaks code using the function introduced with 0.06-4, but that was to
    be shortlived from the start... the i18n features of 0.06-4 will be
    completely replaced with some proper methods now
  - comment nodes (<!-- foo -->) are now globally allowed as child nodes in
    XML; important for i18n comments
  - modifier checks now point to rkwarddev:::all.valid.modifiers directly in
    case of errors
  - internally, moved the definitions of valid child nodes and modifiers as
    well as default getter functions and modifiers to separate files, so
    they're more obvious to find and check
  - rk.XML.input() now checks wheter "size" is exactly one of "small",
    "medium" or "large"
  - rk.JS.doc() now uses a more robust method to set global variables, namely
    by defining an additional function setGlobalVars() and calling that
    inside preprocess()
  - due to changes needed for i18n and rk.JS.header() to work, check your
    "result.header" values, there might be quote issues. for the most part,
    remove quotes you added for rkwarddev >= 0.05-0
  - updated the generation of author and maintainer fileds in DESCRIPTIONs
    made by rk.plugin.skeleton(), borrowing get.authors() from roxyPackage
  - rk.plugin.component() will now also move <dependencies> from <about> to a
    top level child node of plugin XML code, with a warning
  - rk.plugin.skeleton() has a new logical switch called "internal", to set
    some defaults for plugins to be distributed with RKWard itself
  - the "pluginmap" argument of rk.plugin.skeleton() now also accepts
    "namespace"
removed:
  - the functions rk.set.language() rk.get.language() were no longer useful
    and therefore removed
  - also removed the option "lang" from rk.rkh.doc(), rk.XML.plugin(),
    rk.XML.pluginmap() and rk.plugin.skeleton()

changes in version 0.06-5 (2014-10-19)
fixed:
  - the "show" feature in rk.plugin.skeleton() was broken due to changes in
    the namespace defaults
  - scanning plugin XML code for JS and help related content didn't work as
    expected in rk.plugin.component()
  - rk.rkh.scan() now also recognises <optioncolumn> and <matrix> nodes
  - a logical bug prevented rk.plugin.component() to run with default values
    for XML
  - internal function paste.JS.options(), used by rk.JS.options(), was only
    working correctly for the "then" part if ite() statements in arrays; now
    also produces usable code for an "else" part, if available
added:
  - new functions rk.XML.valueselector(),  rk.XML.valueslot() and the
    combining rk.XML.values() to define <valueselector> and <valueslot> nodes,
    similar to rk.XML.varselector(),  rk.XML.varslot() and rk.XML.vars()
  - new function rk.XML.select() to define <select> nodes
  - new functions rk.set.rkh.prompter() and rk.get.rkh.prompter() to make it
    easier to generate help files (later...)
  - rk.rkh.scan() (and automatically rk.plugin.skeleton() and
    rk.plugin.component()) are now capable of fetching text set with rk.set.rkh.prompter()
    and use it to generate help files
  - all functions scanned by rk.rkh.scan() for setting nodes in .rkh files
    have gained two additional arguments, "help" and "component", to register
    the text to be used via rk.set.rkh.prompter()
  - new function rk.XML.option() to allow setting and accessing IDs for
    single options as well
  - new function rk.JS.optionset() and object class "rk.JS.oset" to generate
    for loops over <optionset> columns
changed:
  - updated the plugin skeleton example script; e.g., it now uses the new
    .rkh file generating features
  - rk.XML.radio() and rk.XML.dropdown() now also accept objects made with
    rk.XML.option() in their respective list of options
  - renamed all class definition files due to include problems with
    roxygenize()
  - allow non-maintainers to omit email addresses in <about> nodes

changes in version 0.06-4 (2014-09-14)
added:
  - new functions rk.set.language(), rk.get.language() and i18n() to
    facilitate static internationalisation of plugins; makes use of a new internal
    environment .rkdev.env
  - new parameter "lang" in functions rk.rkh.doc(), rk.XML.plugin(),
    rk.XML.pluginmap() and rk.plugin.skeleton() for internationalisation. if used, the
    attributes "lang" and "xml:lang" will be set in the <document> root of
    the generated files, respectively
  - new parameter "localized" in rk.XML.require() for internationalisation
  - the document id in rk.XML.pluginmap() can now be set manually
fixed:
  - abbreviation of labels now limits valid characters to [0-9A-Za-z]
  - in rk.XML.pluginmap(), "components" and "hierarchy" may be set to NULL if
    "require" is used accordingly

changes in version 0.06-3 (2013-12-21)
fixed:
  - fixed outdated example code for rk.plugin.component()
added:
  - new function rk.uniqueIDs() checks for duplicate IDs
  - rk.JS.array() can now be told to quote values
changed:
  - rk.plugin.component() and rk.rkh.doc() do now interpret the "hints"
    argument to prevent the generation of optional XML nodes.
  - rk.plugin.component() now automatically calls rk.uniqueIDs() and stops if
    IDs are not unique

changes in version 0.06-2 (2013-04-04)
changed:
  - the structure of <about> nodes will change in RKWard 0.6.1,
    <dependencies> will become a direct child of <document> or <component>, which explains
    several changes in this release. this is not really critical, because this
    information wasn't evaluated by RKWard until now anyway
  - for consistency, from now on <component> is never an empty node
  - rk.XML.pluginmap(), rk.XML.plugin() and rk.plugin.skeleton() will now
    move <dependencies> from <about> to a top level child node of plugin maps,
    with a warning
  - from rk.plugin.component() and rk.XML.plugin(), the "pluginmap" argument
    was replaced by the more general "include", which can now also process a
    vector of file names
  - the object class rk.JS.var gained a new slot "getter" to set a default JS
    function to query variable values. it defaults to "getValue" to ensure
    compatibility with earlier releases. consequently, rk.JS.vars() and
    rk.paste.JS() have a new  "getter" argument to set or overwrite this value.
    another new argument, "guess.getter", can be used to turn on automatic guessing
    which getter function might be most appropriate. this was also added to
    rk.plugin.component() and rk.plugin.skeleton().
  - updated the skeleton_dialog.R demo file and recreated the plugin code
  - JavaScript functions like rk.JS.scan() and id() learned how to treat
    <optionset>, <optioncolumn> and <matrix>
  - internally paste(..., sep="") was replaced with paste0(...), in a way
    that ensures compatibility with R < 2.15
added:
  - new function rk.XML.switch()
  - new function rk.XML.optiondisplay()
  - new function rk.XML.optionset()
  - new function rk.XML.matrix()
  - new function rk.XML.dependencies()
  - new function rk.XML.dependency_check()
  - new function join() to simplify ".join()" for JavaScript arrays
  - added options "dependencies", "namespace" and "priority" to
    rk.XML.pluginmap()
  - added option "dependencies" to rk.XML.component()
  - added "map" to rk.XML.require()
  - the new class rk.JS.echo allows having objects in an echo() statement
    without quoting it
  - new combined modifiers "visible.not", "visible.numeric", "enabled.not",
    "enabled.numeric", "state.not" and "state.numeric" are now supported
  - modifiers have been added for <optionset> and <matrix>, and <switch> can
    have any modifier
fixed:
  - added some missing parameter in the docs for rk.paste.JS.graph()
  - fixed a bug in the modifier checks; this unveiled a bug in how
    rk.JS.scan() dealt with <frame> nodes, which was also fixed
  - fixed a duplicate entry in this ChangeLog for version 0.04-6
  - rk.plugin.skeleton() now correctly works with more than one author
  - pluginmap files are no longer included into plugin XML files automatically

changes in version 0.06-1 (2012-11-08)
changed:
  - rk.plugin.skeleton(): "tests" will now ignore "overwrite" and not replace
    existing testsuite files
fixed:
  - dots will now be removed from pluginmap IDs
  - modifiers of "external" XML nodes will not be checked, since it can be
    all kinds of stuff

changes in version 0.05-8 (2012-09-30)
added:
  - new function rk.plotOptions() and class "rk.plot.opts" to simplify code
    generation for plots; this also caused changes in the internal workflow,
    especially for child.node() and rk.paste.JS()
changed:
  - rk.paste.JS.graph() also takes objects of class "rk.plot.opts"
  - rk.XML.embed() now supresses the label if "button=FALSE"

changes in version 0.05-7 (2012-09-29)
added:
  - new function rk.paste.JS.graph() to simplify JS code generation for plots

changes in version 0.05-6 (2012-05-10)
added:
  - rk.XML.wizard() and rk.XML.dialog() can now set the "recommended"
    attribute

changes in version 0.05-5 (2012-04-19)
added:
  - rk.plugin.skeleton() can now also generate initial ChangeLog files (but
    won't overwrite existing ones)
  - added a LICENSE file to the sources
  - sources were initially debianized by roxyPackage
changed:
  - if files are being skipped by rk.plugin.skeleton(), the corresponding
    warning will now include the 'create' actions that these files belong to
fixed:
  - rk.paste.JS() pastes rk.comment() objects correctly again

changes in version 0.05-4 (2012-04-06)
fixed:
  - rk.XML.frame() didn't generate attributes due to a typo

changes in version 0.05-3 (2012-03-18)
  - fixed: rk.XML.text() now preserves XML tags in the text value
  - internally, functions now call XiMpLe::XMLNode() and XiMpLe::XMLTree()
    constructors instead of new(), and pasteXMLNode() and pasteXMLTree() were
    globally renamed into pasteXML()
  - internally, replaced object@node with slot(object, "node")
  - internally, moved checks for valid child and parent nodes to an internal
    functions, valid.child() and valid.parent()

  - removed superfluous "level=1" arguments from automatic "rk.header()"s in
    rk.JS.doc()

    rk.JS.ite objects to rk.paste.JS()

changes in version 0.05-0 (2011-12-14)

    can have R objects pasted. previous scripts need to be adapted accordingly!
    the headers can also be deactivated by setting to FALSE or ""
  - fixed show method for objects of class rk.JS.var with more than one
    variable object
  - added support for global variables to rk.JS.doc() and
    rk.plugin.component(), and therefore also rk.plugin.skeleton()

  - left over stuff from JS printout() function is now added to doPrintout()

changes in version 0.04-8 (2011-11-10)
  - R 2.14 creates source archives which are incompatible with earlier

  - added long description support to rk.XML.about(), used for the
    DESCRIPTION file

    considered only if checkable
  - improved output of rk.JS.var class objects by rk.paste.JS()

changes in version 0.04-5 (2011-10-28)
  - set dependency of rkward to >= 0.5.6 to work around a glitch in rkward's
    package versioning. this can cause errors on real 0.5.6 installations
    because they lack functions introduced in 0.5.7 (to add & load a plugin
    automatically), but shouldn't really break anything
  - added support to turn off modifier checks to rk.XML.set()
  - added option "load.silencer" to rk.JS.doc(), to easily add a switch to
    turn off package load messages in output.

changes in version 0.04-4 (2011-10-26)
  - fixed bug in check for valid modifiers (used to warn when mixed lists
    with/without modifiers were given)
  - fixed bug in rk.XML.convert() (false output if provided with list without
    modifiers)
  - added option "check.modifiers" to rk.JS.vars()

changes in version 0.04-3 (2011-10-22)
  - added support for definint doPrintout() JS functions to rk.JS.doc(),
    rk.plugin.skeleton() and rk.plugin.component()
  - added function rk.comment() to add comments to the generated code. it's a
    <!-- comment --> node by default, but will be turned into // comment by
    rk.paste.JS() and <![CDATA[ comment ]]> for logic sections automatically
  - added option "gen.info" to all file producing functions, to add a comment
    note that the file was generated and changes should be made to the script
    rather than the code directly
  - fixed missing "id.name" option in rk.XML.embed()
  - fixed automatic menu hierarchy generation for lists of legth 1 in
    rk.XML.pluginmap()

changes in version 0.04-2 (2011-10-21)
  - removed the superfluous "name" option from rk.plugin.skeleton() and
    rk.plugin.component(); names are now always provided by "about", either as an
    <about> node or just the name.
  - result headers now start at level 1 by default in rk.JS.doc()
  - added option "suggest.required" to rk.plugin.skeleton() to add package
    requirements as suggestions, not dependencies
  - updated skeleton GUI dialog

changes in version 0.04-1 (2011-10-20)
  - added "about" option to rk.XML.plugin() to overrule pluginmap defaults
  - added rk.plugin.component(), i.e. modularized the component generation,
    to allow for more than one component in rk.plugin.skeleton(), which
    subsequently gained the new option "components"
  - improved dependency support, rk.plugin.skeleton() writes dependencies
    from <about> to DESCRIPTION now
  - fixed dependency definition in rk.XML.about()
  - fixed "verion" typo in rk.XML.about()
  - the dot "." is now also allowed in file names

  - added "checkable" and "checked" options to rk.XML.frame()
  - set rk.paste.JS() default level to 2
  - fixed bug in rk.JS.array() (superfluous "=" in generated code)

  - lifted rkward package dependecies to 0.5.7 (needed for
    rk.load.pluginmaps())

    under certain circumstances)
  - fixed bug in rk.XML.pluginmap() for automatic component IDs
  - fixed bug in rk.plugin.skeleton() for cases where XML file exists and is
    not overwritten, but JS/help files need to be generated
  - cleaned up rk.XML.pluginmap() and rk.XML.plugin() hint code
  - changed "nodes" option to "..." also in rk.XML.menu()
  - added beginnings of a vignette (to be continued...)

changes in version 0.03-3 (2011-10-09)
  - replaced most of the "nodes" and "children" options with "..." in
    functions rk.rkh.related(), rk.rkh.settings(), rk.XML.col(), rk.XML.components(),
    rk.XML.context(), rk.XML.dialog(), rk.XML.frame(), rk.XML.hierarchy(),
    rk.XML.logic(), rk.XML.page(), rk.XML.row(), rk.XML.snippet(),
    rk.XML.snippets() and rk.XML.wizard(). therefore, you don't need to list() objects any
    more.

changes in version 0.03-0 (2011-10-07)
  - redesigned options for rk.plugin.skeleton() again, to make them more
    intuitive and flexible at the same time. unfortunately, this breaks backwards
    compatibility again.
  - rk.plugin.skeleton() and rk.XML.pluginmap() now only accept
    rk.XML.about() made objects for "about"
  - rk.plugin.skeleton() uses internal function XML2person() to create nicer
    Authors@R entries in DESCRIPTION
  - fixed bug in id() (now generates JS variable names, not XML IDs)

changes in version 0.02-5 (2011-10-06)
  - added functions rk.rkh.caption(), rk.rkh.link(), rk.rkh.related(),
    rk.rkh.section(), rk.rkh.setting(), rk.rkh.settings(), rk.rkh.summary(),
    rk.rkh.technical(), rk.rkh.title() and rk.rkh.usage()
  - rk.rkh.doc() now only accepts nodes of the above functions as input (and
    gained support for title and sections)
  - rk.rkh.scan() now also looks for captions
  - added full help page support to rk.plugin.skeleton()
  - added support for properties to rk.JS.vars()
  - added function rk.JS.saveobj() to generate JS code for saveobject nodes.
  - added function rk.JS.options() to generate code for JS variables holding
    multiple options
  - added class rk.JS.opt and a show method for it (use rk.paste.JS() on that)
  - id() and echo() now also replace objects of classes rk.JS.opt and
    rk.JS.arr with their relevant ID
  - linked "Introduction to Writing Plugins for RKWard" locally to the manual
    pages

changes in version 0.02-4 (2011-10-03)
  - some experimental JavaScript generator tools added, might very well be
    changed soon again: - added functions rk.JS.vars(), echo(), id(), ite() and
    rk.paste.JS() to help generate JavaScript code - added classes rk.JS.ite,
    rk.JS.arr and show methods for them - function rk.JS.array() now returns
    an object of class rk.JS.arr (use rk.paste.JS() on that)

changes in version 0.02-3 (2011-09-30)
  - added functions rk.XML.attribute(), rk.XML.component(),
    rk.XML.components(), rk.XML.context(), rk.XML.entry(), rk.XML.hierarchy(), rk.XML.menu()
    and rk.XML.require()
  - rk.plugin.skeleton() and rk.XML.pluginmap() now use the new functions,
    which makes them much more flexible
  - added option "menu" to rk.plugin.skeleton()
  - added options "require", "x11.context", "import.context" and "hints" to
    rk.XML.pluginmap()
  - removed now superfluous option "plugin.dir" from rk.XML.pluginmap()
  - tuned rk.plugin.skeleton() to only skip file writing if they exist
