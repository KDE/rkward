Description: GNU R package: Provides a simple XML tree parser/generator. It includes functions to read XML files into R objects, get information out of and into nodes, and write R objects back to XML code. It's not as
 powerful as the 'XML' package and doesn't aim to be, but for simple XML handling it could be useful. It was originally developed for the R GUI and IDE RKWard (https://rkward.kde.org), to make plugin development easier.
