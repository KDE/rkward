Description: Provides a simple XML tree parser/generator. It includes functions
    to read XML files into R objects, get information out of and into nodes, and
    write R objects back to XML code. It's not as powerful as the 'XML' package
    and doesn't aim to be, but for simple XML handling it could be useful. It was
    originally developed for the R GUI and IDE RKWard (https://rkward.kde.org), to
    make plugin development easier.
