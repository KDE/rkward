\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-17 (2013-02-04)}{
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item added proper \code{is.XiMpLe.node()} and \code{is.XiMpLe.doc()} functions
      \item added getter functions for all slots in XiMpLe.node and XiMpLe.doc objects
        (e.g., \code{getXMLName()} to get the name slot of a XiMpLe.node object)
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-16 (2012-11-05)}{
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item added examples to all functions
      \item added a vignette
      \item additional tests for \code{node()}<-
    }
  }
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item fixed dropping of last tag/text value if XML was incomplete, e.g., just
        an excerpt of a full tree
      \item fixed handling of empty tags completely without space, e.g. "<br/>"
        instead of "<br />"
      \item parsing error for DOCTYPE nodes mixed up elements and previously ignored
        the \code{"decl"} value
      \item \code{node()}<- now replaces both text values and pseudo tags with a new value.
        this can still be problematic for child nodes which contain a mix of
        pseudo and actual tags, so a warning will be given until this is resolved
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{node()} now reports text values of nodes which have \code{"value"} and a pseudo
        tag at the same time as one character string, like pasteXML does
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-15 (2012-10-26)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item eliminated a memory problem for large XML trees. calling \code{unlist()} with
        use.names=FALSE really makes a difference...
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item reviewed the garbage collecting and internally moved it out of
        \code{XML.nodes()} into \code{XML.single.tags()}
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-14 (2012-05-11)}{
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item forcing garbage collection \code{gc()} in internal function \code{XML.nodes()}, which
        iterates through parsed XML trees
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item better handling of text value indentation via \code{"shine"} and \code{"tidy"}
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-13 (2012-04-19)}{
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item added a LICENSE file
      \item debianized the sources
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{parseXMLTree()} now takes connections as \code{"file"} parameter
      \item commented CDATA tags (like they're used in XHTML) can now be detected and
        pasted
      \item \code{pasteXMLTag()} adjusts indentation level of value tags and comments
    }
  }
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item feeding internet addresses to \code{parseXMLTree()} no longer throws an error,
        skipping \code{normalize.path()} then now
      \item \code{parseXMLTree()} now preserves newlines in value tags and comments
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-12 (2012-03-18)}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{node()} now also works with single XiMpLe.node objects (not only full
      trees)
    \item added pasteXML methods to paste objects of classes XiMpLe.node and
      XiMpLe.doc in a more general manner. the former functions \code{pasteXMLNode()} and
      \code{pasteXMLTree()} are replaced by mere wrapper frunctions to \code{pasteXML()} and
      should not be used any longer.
    \item fixed dropped text value if node also had child nodes in \code{pasteXML()}
    \item fixed missing quotes in DOCTYPE id (\code{pasteXML()})
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-11 (2012-03-14)}{
  \itemize{
    \item added functions \code{XMLNode()} and \code{XMLTree()} as constructor functions for XML
      nodes and trees.
    \item added opton \code{"object"} to \code{parseXMLTree()}, to be able to parse XML trees not
      only from files, but also character vectors
    \item output of internal function \code{XML.single.tags()} has no colname any more
    \item text values of nodes are no longer followed by an empty newline in
      \code{pasteXMLNode()}
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-10 (2012-03-11)}{
  \itemize{
    \item fixed bug in parsing of attributes, their names are now all quoted by
      default o not run into issues if they contain R-sensitive characters (like
      "http-equiv")
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-9 (2012-03-10)}{
  \itemize{
    \item re-formatted the ChangeLog so roxyPackage can translate it into a NEWS.Rd
      file
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-8 (2011-11-17)}{
  \itemize{
    \item rewrote large parts of internal function \code{XML.single.tags()} for more
      efficiency, allthough it's still quite lethargic when handling huge XML trees
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-7 (2011-10-23)}{
  \itemize{
    \item added "&" to the special characters for \code{"tidy"} (only applies if theres

      newline character
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-6 (2011-10-09)}{
  \itemize{
    \item added \code{"tidy"} option to the paste functions, which is TRUE by default
      since "<" and ">" are invalid in attributes and text anyway
  }
}
\section{Changes in XiMpLe version 0.03-5 (2011-10-07)}{
  \itemize{
    \item fixed tree parsing bug (in rare cases, comment and CDATA entries caused

      the wrong class object, but a warning is given

      setting/indentation
