ChangeLog for package XiMpLe

## 0.03-8 (2011-11-17)
  - rewrote large parts of internal function XML.single.tags() for more efficiency, allthough it's still quite
    lethargic when handling huge XML trees

## 0.03-7 (2011-10-23)
  - added "&" to the special characters for "tidy" (only applies if theres space before and after)
  - "tidy" now also indents text in comments and CDATA if it includes the newline character

## 0.03-6 (2011-10-09)
  - added "tidy" option to the paste functions, which is TRUE by default since "<" and ">" are
    invalid in attributes and text anyway

## 0.03-5 (2011-10-07)
  - fixed tree parsing bug (in rare cases, comment and CDATA entries caused parsing to choke on
    empty lines)

## 0.03-4 (2011-10-01)
  - added show methods for objects of class XiMpLe.doc and XiMpLe.node

## 0.03-3 (2011-09-27)
  - changed default 'shine' value of pasteXMLNode() and pasteXMLTree() from 2 to 1
  - pasteXMLNode() and pasteXMLTree() now try to call each other if fed with the wrong class object,
    but a warning is given
  - changed handling of 'value' in pasteXMLNode(), now reflects 'shine' setting/indentation

## 0.03-2 (2011-09-17)
  - added docs for classed XiMpLe.doc and XiMpLe.node

## 0.03-1 (2011-09-11)
  - fixed outstanding issue with complex value structures
  - changed "Author@R" to "Authors@R" in DESCRIPTION (for R >= 2.14)

  - fixed missing "methods" dependecy
  - adjusted docs a little

## 0.02-1 (2011-08-30)
  - added option "indent.by" to the paste functions, in case one prefers space over tab.
  - moved all rk.* functions out of this package and into its own (rkwardplugdev)

## 0.01-9 (2011-08-28)
  - tiny improvements to XML formatting
  - added functions rk.XML.tabbook(), rk.XML.dropdown(), rk.XML.plugin()
