ChangeLog for package XiMpLe

changes in version 0.03-11 (2012-03-13)
  - added functions XMLNode() and XMLTree() as constructor functions for XML nodes and trees.
  - added opton "object" to parseXMLTree(), to be able to parse XML trees not only from files, but also character vectors
  - output of internal function XML.single.tags() has no colname any more
  - text values of nodes are no longer followed by an empty newline in pasteXMLNode()

changes in version 0.03-10 (2012-03-11)
  - fixed bug in parsing of attributes, their names are now all quoted by default o not run into issues
    if they contain R-sensitive characters (like "http-equiv")

changes in version 0.03-9 (2012-03-10)
  - re-formatted the ChangeLog so roxyPackage can translate it into a NEWS.Rd file

changes in version 0.03-8 (2011-11-17)
  - rewrote large parts of internal function XML.single.tags() for more efficiency, allthough it's still quite
    lethargic when handling huge XML trees

changes in version 0.03-7 (2011-10-23)
  - added "&" to the special characters for "tidy" (only applies if theres space before and after)

changes in version 0.03-6 (2011-10-09)

    invalid in attributes and text anyway

changes in version 0.03-5 (2011-10-07)
