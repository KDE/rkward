Important note
==================

RKward will not function correctly until it is installed properly. In particular, you will not see some important menus otherwise.
Please see INSTALL for details.


Release notes / state of the app
==================

RKWard is not yet finished and it has not even reached the point of being a useful application. Way to go!

The purpose of the current release of RKWard is to give some idea of what RKWard will look like on day, and to test and demonstrate some concepts. It is provided in the hope of attracting further developers / getting useful suggestions. It is of no use whatsoever to end-users.

Do not use RKWard to do actual computations yet. Do not use it on valuable data. Expect it to do all sorts of evil things.
