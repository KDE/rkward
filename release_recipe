This procedure helps working around a number of strange problems while creating releases, such as .moc-files not being generated, generated files not being removed, autotools being run again (with bad results) for no good reason... The following procedure seems to eliminate those problems, and thus should be followed for releases. Some items may also serve to keep the package lean.

make clean
make dist
unpack tarball and cd there
rm -r admin/CVS (not yet tested)
make -f Makefile.cvs
rm rkward/rkward_skel.cpp
touch config.h.in
rm -r autom4te.cache
repackage tarball
