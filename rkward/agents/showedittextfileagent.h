/** The purpose of this agent is to display text files for showing and/or editing on request of the R backend. Technically speaking, it gets invoked, whenever the standard R callbacks (ptr_)R_ShowFiles, (ptr_)R_EditFiles, or (ptr_)R_EditFile are called. While the task of simply opening such files for display/editing is rather simple, there is one slightly more difficult issue involved (and hence this class to handle it): In standard R, all these calls are blocking further processing, until the user has closed the shown/edited files. In some cases this may be necessary (for instance if R wants to use with the edited files immediately), in some cases this is an unneccessary nuisance (such as when R simply wants to display a help page or some other purely informational text).

The solution to this, used in this agent, is to display a non-modal dialog with a "Done"-button, and thereby leave the decision to the user. Whenever the user thinks, it's safe to resume processing, the "Done"-button can be pressed, even if the files are still open. Until that time, processing is halted.

You probably don't want to create an instance of this agent directly. Rather use the static showEditFiles ().
