/** This is a simple helper class helping in catching R X11 device windows. The start () and stop () functions are called from RInterface, and then this class takes care of handling those.

The main difficulty to overcome in this context, is to find out, when an R X11 window is created, and what is its X Window id. The notes below are some thoughts on that matter. Probably mostly obsolete, now (the current approach is basically Plan C, and seems to work ok), but maybe Plans A or B or something similar will become necessary some day:

Catch R X11 device windows
- Plan A:
	- initialization function seems to be in_do_X11
	- it might be possible to put a wrapper around this using R_setX11Routines
	- this wrapper could watch the list of devices (curDevice, numDevices), see also addDevice to find out how the list is kept internally
	- if a new device gets added grab its winId and capture
- Plan B:
	- it looks like there's no way to get access to R_setX11Routines or at least the needed struct R_X11Routines. (?)
	- the level above that seems to be do_X11
	- maybe we can modify the mapping from .Internal (X11) to do_X11 and insert wrapper from Plan A -> R_FunTab
	- proceed like in Plan A
	- less preferable as C-plugins might be able to call do_X11 directly (can they?)
- Plan C:
	- modify at R level (override X11 ())
		- notify app right before device is created
		- notify app right after device is created
	- least preferable solution as we can not be sure we catch every use.
		- but definitely most. This is dispatched via CurrentDevice ()->options("device"), and then evalued in R_GlobalEnv
- remaining problem: how to get the window id given the device id?
	- http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/events/window-state-change/create.html#XCreateWindowEvent
	- for active / inactive: XPropertyEvent WM_NAME
	- we may catch this using KApplication::x11EventFilter
	- event filter should only be active during the wrapper (Plan A-C)
	- event filter should probably do some sanity checking
	- this should give us the window id corresponding to the x11-call
