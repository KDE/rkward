/** This class is used to encapsulate an R-command, so it can be easiyl identified
	in a chain of commands. It is needed, since communication with R is asynchronous
	and it is therefore not possible to get the result of an R-call right away.
	Instead, create an object of this class, specifying the object/slot that should
	be called when the command has finished. You can then retrieve all information
	on the command (including the reply) from the object that is passed to your slot.
	If one slot is to handle the output of several different commands, use the id ()
	function to keep track of the command (it returns a unique id assigned to this
	object). Do not try to keep a pointer to the command. It will be deleted after
	completion (or when/if the R-process dies).
	The type-parameter is used to indicate the significance of this command, and
	esp., whether it should be hidden from the user. (Not yet implemented)
