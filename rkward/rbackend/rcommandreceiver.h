/**
Use this class as a base for all classes that need to handle RCommands. Provides a pure virtual function (rCommandDone ()) for handling of RCommand-results. Reimplement this to interpret the command-results.
For windows/dialogs which interpret RCommand results, the receiver provides a special mechanism. The problem with those windows/dialogs is, that the user may close them, while there are still RCommands due to come in, i.e. they can't be deleted, but rather need to wait for the remaining results to come in.
This class will keep track of which RCommands are still out there (and expected to return to this receiver). If you call deleteThis (), the RCommandReceiver will either self-destruct immediately or wait for any remaining commands to come in. Warning: This means, your class may be delelted immediately. You should return at once after calling deleteThis ().
