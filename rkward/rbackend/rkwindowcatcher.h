/** This class will be used to find out, when R opens a new X11-device, find out the id of that device and embed it into a QWidget.

Unfortunately this does not work, yet. Right when trying to embed the window, there is a crash (R segfaults; this also happens when trying to catch a window from another separate R process, so it really seems to be R's fault!). Therefore this class is currently deactivated.
To reactivate it, modify the corresponding Makefile.am, uncomment the x11-override in rpackages/rkward/R/internal.R, and uncomment the
window_catcher/RKWindowCatcher lines in rinterface.h and rinterface.cpp. Maybe I'll add some #ifdefs instead...

Given the problems with fetching the window Id (currently only possible by searching for the window title), it's probably a lot easier to instead create a single R call: .rk.catch.window (title="R Graphics: Device...", graph_device_number) that will directly trigger catching.


Here are some more notes I have taken on the subject of catching R's x11 windows. Current approach is Plan C for simplicity.
- Plan A:
	- initialization function seems to be in_do_X11
	- it might be possible to put a wrapper around this using R_setX11Routines
	- this wrapper could watch the list of devices (curDevice, numDevices), see also addDevice to find out how the list is kept internally
	- if a new device gets added grab its winId and capture (using QXEmbed?)!
- Plan B:
	- it looks like there's no way to get acces to R_setX11Routines or at least the needed struct R_X11Routines. (?)
	- the level above that seems to be do_X11
	- maybe we can modify the mapping from .Internal (X11) to do_X11 and insert wrapper from Plan A -> R_FunTab
	- proceed like in Plan A
	- less preferable as C-plugins might be able to call do_X11 directly (can they?)
- Plan C:
	- modify at R level (override X11 ())
		- notify app right before device is created
		- notify app right after device is created
	- least preferable solution as we can not be sure we catch every use.
		- but definitely most. This is dispatched via CurrentDevice ()->options("device"), and then evalued in R_GlobalEnv
- remaining problem: how to get the window id given the device id?
	- http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/events/window-state-change/create.html#XCreateWindowEvent
	- we may catch this using KApplication::installlX11EventFilter
	- event filter should only be active during the wrapper (Plan A-C)
	- event filter should probably do some sanity checking
	- this should give us the window id corresponding to the x11-call
