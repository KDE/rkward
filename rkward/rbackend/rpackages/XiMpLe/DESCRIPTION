Description: This package provides a simple XML tree
    parser/generator. It includes functions to read XML
    files into R objects, get information out of and into
    nodes, and write R objects back to XML code.  It's not
    as powerful as the XML package and doesn't aim to be,
    but for simple XML handling it could be useful. It was
    originally programmed for RKWard.
