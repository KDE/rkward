\title{(Re-)load the given pluginmap files into the RKWard GUI}
\usage{
rk.load.pluginmaps(pluginmap.files = NULL, force.add = TRUE,
  force.reload = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pluginmap.files}{a character vector of file names to add. This may be left empty,
if the only desired effect is to reload all active pluginmaps.}

\item{force.add}{logical. Whether the pluginmap files should also be added, if they had
been previously de-selected in the settings menu, and regardless of their
priority setting. In scripted usage, this should generally be set to FALSE.}

\item{force.reload}{logical. By default the active pluginmaps are reloaded, only if any new ones
                    were added. If set to TRUE, pluginmaps are reloaded in any case. In
                    scripted usage, this should generally be set to FALSE. NOTE: Since
                    a reload always means reloading _all_ active pluginmaps, This may be
                    slow, and should be used with care.

\bold{Note}: It is not necessary to reload the pluginmap, in order to refresh an individual
             plugin (e.g. after modifying the dialog), as plugins are not kept in memory after closing.
             Any currently opened plugins are not affected by this function.}
