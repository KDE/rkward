\title{Slightly smarter variant of old.packages()}
\usage{
  rk.old.packages(lib.loc = NULL,
    repos = getOption("repos"),
    contriburl = contrib.url(repos, type),
    instPkgs = installed.packages(lib.loc = lib.loc),
    method, available = NULL, checkBuilt = FALSE,
    type = getOption("pkgType"))
}
\value{
  a character vector of packages which are really old
}
\description{
  For most purposes, this function is identical to
  old.packages(). However, if the same package is installed
  to different locations, in different versions,
  old.packages() will treat each of these installations
  separately. Thus, e.g. if lib.loc == c("A", "B") and
  package X is installed in B at an outdated version 0.1,
  but in A at the most recent version 0.2, old.packages()
  will report package X at B as old. In contrast
  rk.old.packages() will recognize that the current version
  is higher up in the path, and not report package X as
  old.
