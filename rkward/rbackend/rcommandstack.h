/**
This class represents a top-level RCommandChain. There are/will be two (types of) such chains: One for commands sent to the R-backend for "regular" evaluation, and one for commands sent in reply to a (modal) request from the R-backend via the RRequestHandler.
The class provides convenience functions for determining the state of the Stack (empty/blocked/active) and inserting and fetching commands in the correct order.
Remember to lock RInterface::mutex before accessing any of these functions!
