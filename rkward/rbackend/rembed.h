/** This class (together with its base class REmbedInternal) takes care of the low level
	communication with the R-backend. It should only be used encapsulated in a thread, so
	commands get executed non-blocking.

	Only one REmbed-object can be used in an application.

	Don't use this class in RKWard directly. Use the interface provided by RInterface, instead.
	REmbed could really be merged with RThread. Don't wonder about strange up-and-down calls.
	Also REmbed and REmbedInternal are only separate for technical reasons (R-includes and Qt-includes clashing).
