/** This class represents the thread the R backend is running in. So to speak, this is where the "eventloop" of R is running. The main thing happening
in this class, is that it enters R's REPL (Read-evaluate-parse-loop). Whenever there are commands to be executed, those get evaluated. When there are not,
processing of X11-Events in R is triggered. The rest of the time the thread sleeps.

Actually, there is also a custom sub-eventloop, which gets called when the R backend has requested something. See handleRequest(). In this case, we might have to run some further child commands in the backend, before we proceed with the commands in the main queque. Some thing like:

- Run some RCommand s
	- R backend asks for some information / action
		- potentially some more RCommand s are needed to accomplish this request
			- (additional levels of substacks)
		- return the result
	- R backend request completed
- Run some more RCommand s

This subordinate/nested eventloop is done in handleRequest ().

A closely related class is RInterface: RThread communicates with RInterface by placing QCustomEvent s, when commands are done
or when the backend needs information from the frontend. For historical reasons, the definitions of RThread class-members are currently spread over different files.

Only one RThread-object can be used in an application.
Don't use this class in RKWard directly. Unless you really want to modify the internal workings of the backend, you will want to look at RInterface and use the functions there.
