/** This struct is an ugly hack that allows us to pass all R standard callbacks to the main thread and back using the same mechanism.
Basically, it contains enough space for all arguments and return values ever used. However, of course, it is inherently totally unsafe.
All rests on having the handling functions know exactly, how these variables are used. So be extremely careful with modifications!

Also, of course, this method of passing the arguments is somewhat wasteful, as most of the time we're alocating a lot more memory than needed.
However, since all R standard callbacks are used very infrequently (and ask for user interaction), this is not really an issue.

The bool done member is used to find out, when exactly the main thread has finished processing the callback. */
