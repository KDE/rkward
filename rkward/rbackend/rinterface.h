\page UsingTheInterfaceToR Using the Interface to R
\brief An Introduction to using the R-backend: Running commands in R and handling the results

This page tries to give you an introduction into using the RInterface and related classes. You'll learn how to submit a command for evaluation
by R and how you can get and handle the results. Note that is fairly low-level. You do not need to read this documentation in order to develop
plugins. You'll only need to know this in order to do C++-hacking in rkward.
The page is divided into several sections on special problems, but if you're new to rkward, you will probably want to read it as a whole instead of
jumping right to those sections.

\section UsingTheInterfaceToRTheSimpleCase The simple case: Fire and forget

In the most simple case, all you want to do is to send a command to be evaluated executed in the R backend, and you are not interested in what
happens (whether the command runs successfully, or what the output is). For this, all you need is the following
code:

\code
#include "rkglobals.h"
#include "rbackend/rinterface.h"

RKGlobals::rInter->issueCommand ("print (\"hello world!\")", RCommand::User);
\endcode

You will note, that actually there are two RInterface::issueCommand functions, this one is obviously the one taking a QString and several further
parameters as argument. It is actually quite similar to the other RInterface::issueCommand function which takes an RCommand as a paramter. This convenience class basically just creates an RCommand with the same parameters as the constructor of RCommand (RCommand::RCommand), and then submits this RCommand. We'll discuss what an RCommand really is further down below. For now a good enough explanations is, that it's simply a container for a command.

The first parameter here, is fairly obvious, the command-string the R backend should evaluate.

The second parameter (RCommand::User) is and integer, which can be a bit-wise or-able combination of the values in the RCommand::CommandTypes enum. We'll deal with the more specific values in that enum later. Here, were just using RCommand::User, which signifies, that the command came
directly from the user. This information is fairly important, as it affects the handling of the command at several places: Which color it will be given in
the R-command log (currently class RKWatch), whether the command can be cancelled (RCommand::User commands can be cancelled, but some other types of commands can not be cancelled), etc. See the documentation on RCommand::CommandTypes (not yet complete) for more information.

\section UsingTheInterfaceToRHandlingReturns A slightly more realistic example: Handling the result of an RCommand

Most of the time you don't just want to run a command, but you also want to know the result. Now, this is a tad bit more difficult than one might expect at first glance. The reason for this is, that the R backend runs in a separate thread. Hence, whenever you submit a command, it generally does not get executed right away - or at least you just don't know, when exactly it gets executed, and when the result is available. This is neccessary, so (expensive) commands running in the backend do not block operations in the GUI/frontend.

Ok, so how do you get informed, when you command was completed? Using RCommandReceiver. What you will want to do is inherit the class you
want to handle the results of RCommands from RCommandReceiver. When finished, the RCommand will be submitted to the (pure virtual) RCommandReceiver::rCommandDone function, which of course you'll have to implement in a meaningful way in your derived class.

The corresponding code would look something like this:

\code
#include "rkglobals.h"
#include "rbackend/rinterface.h"
#include "rbackend/rcommandreceiver.h"

class MyReceiver : public RCommandReceiver {
//...
protected:
/// receives finished RCommands and processes them
	void rCommandDone (RCommand *command);
//...
private:
/// does something by submitting an RCommand
	void someFunction ();
//...
};


void MyReceiver::someFunction () {
	RKGlobals::rInter->issueCommand ("print (1+1)", RCommand::App, "", this);
}

void MyReceiver::rCommandDone (RCommand *command) {
	if (command->successful ()) {
		qDebug ("Result was %s", command->output ()->utf8 ());
	}
}
\endcode

First thing to note is, that this time we're passing two additional parameters to RInterface::issueCommand. The first (or rather third) is really not used as of the time of this writing. What it's meant to become is a short descriptive string attached to the RCommand, that allows the user to make some sense of what this command is all about. The other (fourth) is a pointer to an RCommandReceiver that should be informed of the result. In this case, we'll handle the result in the same object that we issued the command from, so we use "this".

So next the RCommand created with RInterface::issueCommand goes on its way to/through the backend (we'll discuss what happens there further down below). Then later, when it has completed its journey, rCommandDone will be called with a pointer to the command as parameter. Now we can use this pointer to retrieve the information we need to know. RCommand::successful and some further simple functions give information about whether the command had any errors and what kind of errors (see RCommand for details). RCommand::output contains the output of the command as a QString (provided the command was successful and had any output). In this case that should be "[1] 2".

\section UsingTheInterfaceToRMultipleCommands Dealing with several RCommands in the same object

In many cases you don't just want to deal with a single RCommand in an RCommandReceiver, but rather you might submit a bunch of different command (for instance to find out about several different properties of an object in R-space), and then use some special handling for each of those commands. So the problem is, how to find out, which of your commands you're currently dealing with in rCommandDone.

There are several ways to deal with this:

	- storing the RCommand::id () (each command is automatically assigned a unique id, TODO: do we need this functionality? Maybe remove it for redundancy)
	- passing appropriate flags to know how to handle the command
	- keeping the pointer (CAUTION: don't use that pointer except to compare it with the pointer of an incoming command. Commands get deleted when they are finished, and maybe (in the future) if they become obsolete etc. Hence the pointers you keep may be invalid!)

To illustrate the option of using "FLAGS", here is a reduced example of how RKVariable updates information about the dimensions and class of the corresponding object in R-space using two different RCommand s:

\code
#define UPDATE_DIM_COMMAND 1
#define UPDATE_CLASS_COMMAND 2

void RKVariable::updateFromR () {
	//...
	RCommand *command = new RCommand ("length (" + getFullName () + ")", RCommand::App | RCommand::Sync | RCommand::GetIntVector, "", this, UPDATE_DIM_COMMAND);
	RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand (command, RKGlobals::rObjectList()->getUpdateCommandChain ());
}

void RKVariable::rCommandDone (RCommand *command) {
	//...
	if (command->getFlags () == UPDATE_DIM_COMMAND) {
		// ...
		RCommand *ncommand = new RCommand ("class (" + getFullName () + ")", RCommand::App | RCommand::Sync | RCommand::GetStringVector, "", this, UPDATE_CLASS_COMMAND);
		RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand (ncommand, RKGlobals::rObjectList()->getUpdateCommandChain ());
	} else if (command->getFlags () == UPDATE_CLASS_COMMAND) {
		//...
	}
}
\endcode

Note that you can freely assign whatever flags you like. Only your own class will need to know how to interpret the flags.

Now what about that RKGlobals::rObjectList()->getUpdateCommandChain ()? We'll talk about RCommandChain and what you need it for further down below. But first we'll have a look at how an RCommand is handled internally.

\section UsingTheInterfaceToRInternalHandling What happens with an RCommand internally?

So far we've discussed RInterface:issueCommand () and RCommandReceiver::rCommandDone (). But what happens in between?

First the RCommand is placed in a first-in-first-out stack. This stack is needed, since - as discussed - the commands get executed in a separate thread, so several command may get stacked up, before the first one gets run.

Then, in the backend thread (RThread) there is a loop running, which fetches those commands from the stack and executes them one by one. Whenver a command has been executed in this thread, it gets updated with information on any errors that occurred and of course also with the result of running the command. Next, a QCustomEvent is being posted. What this does is basically, transfer the pointer to the command back to the main thread in a safe way.

Whenever the main thread becomes active again, it will find that QCustomEvent and handle it in RInterface::customEvent.

The most important thing happening there, is a call to RCommand::finished (RCommand::finished basically just calls the responsible RCommandReceiver::rCommandDone), and right after that the RCommand gets deleted.

\section UsingTheInterfaceToRThreadingIssues Threading issues

The above description sound simple enough, but there may be some threading issues to keep in mind. Consider what needs to happen when RKVariable is trying to update the information on the corresponding object in R-space (see code example above):

- RKVariable will first run a command to determine the dimensionality of the object.

Now this is more significant than so may think, as RKVariable is a special kind of RObject, which only handles one-dimensional data. Hence, if you create an object in R with

\code
myobject <- c (1, 2, 3)
\endcode

In RKWard an RKVariable will be responsible for "myobject".

However, if next, you assign something different to myobject:

\code
myobject <- data.frame (x=c (1, 2, 3), y=c (2, 3, 4))
\endcode

the object "myobject" can no longer be handled by RKVariable, but instead by RContainerObject.

What this means practically is that if RKVariable finds out its corresponding object in R-space has more than a single dimension, the RKVariable will have to be deleted and an RContainerObject needs to be created instead.

So what's the problem?

Consider this hypothetical example:

- RKVariable for object "myobject" runs a command to determine the dimensionality of "myobject"
- Before that command has finished, the user assigns a data.frame to "myobject" (or deletes the object, or whatever)
- The command to determine the dimensionality gets run and returns "1 dimension". RKVariable will assume it knows how to handle the object, and tries to do something with "myobject" which is only applicable for one-dimensionaly objects (e.g. trying to get the data as a one-dimensional array)
- The user command assigning a data.frame gets run
- RKVariables command to get the data fails

Now, you may argue this does not sound all that likely, and probably it isn't, but the point to see is that there are cases in which the threaded nature of R access can pose some problems. More generally, that is the case, if you want a sequence of commands to run in exactly that order without being disturbed by intervening commands.

To cope with this, it is sometimes desirable to keep closer control over the order in which commands get run in the backend.

\section UsingTheInterfaceToRCommandChains How to ensure commands get executed in the correct order: RCommandChain

The way to do this is to use RCommandChain. Basically, when you want command to be executed in a sequence being sure that no other commands intervene, you do this:

\code
	RCommandChain *chain = RKGlobals::rInterface ()->startChain ();

	// create first command
	RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand (first_command, chain);

	// wait for command to return, potentially allows further calls to RInterface::issueCommand () from other places in the code

	// create second command
	RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand (second_command, chain);

	RKGlobals::rInterface ()->closeChain (chain);
\endcode

Now the point is that you place both of your commands in a dedicated "chain", telling RKWard that those two commands will have to be run in direct succession. If between the first and the second command, another section of the code issues a different command, this command will never be run until all commands in the chain have been run and the chain has been marked as closed.

To illustrate, consider this series of events:

\code
1) RCommandChain *chain = RKGlobals::rInterface ()->startChain ();
2) RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand (first_command, chain);
3) RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand (some_command);
4) RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand (second_command, chain);
5) RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand (some_command2);
6) RKGlobals::rInterface ()->closeChain (chain);
\endcode

Now let's assume for a second, the R backend has been busy doing other stuff and has not executed any of the commands so far, then the execution stack will now look like this:

- top level
	- chain
		- first_command
		- second_command
		- chain is marked as closed: after executing second_command, we may proceed with the top level
	- some_command
	- some_command2

You can also open sub chains, using

\code
RCommandChain *sub_chain = RKGlobals::rInterface ()->startChain (parent_chain);
\endcode

Remember to close chains when you placed all the commands you needed to. If you don't close the chain, RKWard will continue to wait for new commands in that chain, and never proceed with commands outside of the chain.

\section UsingTheInterfaceToROutputOptions Sending results to the output and retrieving low-level data from the backend

There are a few special type-modifiers you can specify when creating and RCommand (as part of the second parameter to RCommand::RCommand or RInterface::issueCommand), that determine what will be done with the result:

- RCommand::EmtpyCommand
This one tells the backend, that the command does not really need to be executed, and does not contain anything. You'll rarely need this flag, but sometimes it is useful to submit an empty command simply to find out when it is finished.

- RCommand::DirectToOutput
This is typically used in plugins: When you specify this modifier, the plain text result of this command (i.e. whatever R prints out when evaluating the command) will be added to the HTML output file. Remember to call RKwardApp::newOutput in order to refresh the output-window once the command has finished.

- RCommand::GetIntVector, RCommand::GetStringVector, RCommand::GetRealVector
These are special modifiers helpful when transferring data from R to RKWard (used primarily in the editor classes and in conjunction with RCommand::Sync): They tell the backend to try to fetch the result as and array of int, char*, or double, respectively. For instance, if you know object "myobject" is an integer vector, you may get the data using

\code
RKGlobals::rInterface ()->issueCommand ("myobject", RCommand::Sync | RCommand::GetIntVector, "",this);
\endcode

Assuming the data can in fact be converted to a vector of integers, you can then access the data using these members in RCommand:

- RCommand::intVectorLength (): size of int array
- RCommand::getIntVector (): a pointer to the int array. Warning: The array is owned by the RCommand and will be deleted together with the RCommand, so don't just store the pointer
- RCommand::detachIntVector (): If you do want to keep the array, use this call to transfer ownership to your class. You are now responsible for freeing up the data yourself.

Obviously, whenever trying to transfer data from the backend, this approach is highly superior to parsing the QString RCommand::output ().
