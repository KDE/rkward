/** This class represents the thread the R backend is running in. So to speak, this is where the "eventloop" of R is running. The main thing happening
in this class, is that an infinite loop is running. Whenever there are commands to be executed, those get evaluated. Also, at regular intervals,
processing of X11-Events in R is triggered. The rest of the time the thread sleeps.

Actually, there are really two copies of the main loop: The regular one, and a second one which gets run when the R backend has requested some
task to be carried out (@see handleSubstackCall). In this case, we might have to run some further child commands in the backend, before we proceed with the commands in
the main queque. Some thing like:

- Run some RCommand s
	- R backend asks for some information / action
		- potentially some more RCommand s are needed to accomplish this request
			- (additional levels of substacks)
		- return the result
	- R backend request completed
- Run some more RCommand s

This subordinate/nested eventloop is done in handleSubstackCall ().

A closely related class is RInterface: RThread communicates with RInterface by placing QCustomEvent s, when commands are done
or when the backend needs information from the frontend. Also RThread and REmbedInternal are only separate for technical reasons (R-includes and Qt-includes clashing).

Only one RThread-object can be used in an application.
Don't use this class in RKWard directly. Unless you really want to modify the internal workings of the backend, you will want to look at RInterface and use the functions there.
