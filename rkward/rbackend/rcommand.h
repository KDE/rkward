/** This class is used to encapsulate an R-command, so it can be easiyl identified
	in a chain of commands. It is needed, since communication with R is asynchronous
	and it is therefore not possible to get the result of an R-call right away.
	Instead, create an object of this class, specifying the object/slot that should
	be called when the command has finished. You can then retrieve all information
	on the command (including the reply) from the object that is passed to your slot.
	If one slot is to handle the output of several different commands, use the id ()
	function to keep track of the command (it returns a unique id assigned to this
	object).
	The type-parameter is used to indicate the significance of this command, and
	esp., whether it should be hidden from the user. (Not yet implemented)
	There are several ways to identify a command when it's finished:
		- using different slotsfor different commands
		- storing the id ()
		- passing appropriate flags to know how to handle the command
		- keeping the pointer (CAUTION: don't use that pointer except to compare it with the pointer of an incoming command. Commands get deleted when they are finished, and maybe (in the future) if they become obsolete etc. Hence the pointers you keep may be invalid!)
		(- checking the command-string)
	Note that an RCommand carries a whole lot of information around. However, RCommands generally don't get
	kept around very long, so they should not be a memory issue.
