/** For introductory information on using RCommand, see \ref UsingTheInterfaceToR 

	This class is used to encapsulate an R-command, so it can be easily identified
	in a chain of commands. It is needed, since communication with R is asynchronous
	and it is therefore not possible to get the result of an R-call right away.
	Instead, create an object of this class, specifying the RCommandReceiver that should
	be called when the command has finished. You can then retrieve all information
	on the command (including the reply) from the object that is passed to your handler.
	
	There are several ways to identify a command when it's finished (needed, if a single RCommandReceiver needs to handle the results of
	several different commands):
		- storing the id () (each command is automatically assigned a unique id, TODO: do we need this functionality? Maybe remove it for redundancy)
		- passing appropriate flags to know how to handle the command
		- keeping the pointer (CAUTION: don't use that pointer except to compare it with the pointer of an incoming command. Commands get deleted when they are finished, and maybe (in the future) if they become obsolete etc. Hence the pointers you keep may be invalid!)
		(- checking the command-string)
	Note that an RCommand carries a whole lot of information around. However, RCommands generally don't get
	kept around very long, so they should not be a memory issue.

@param type An integer being the result of a bit-wise OR combination of the values in RCommand::CommandTypes. The type-parameter is used to indicate the type of command, and also how the command should retrieve information (as a usual string, or as a data vector). See \ref RCommand::CommandTypes
@param rk_equiv Not yet used: a short descriptive string attached to the RCommand, that allows the user to make some sense of what this command is all about.
@param receiver The RCommandReceiver this command should be passed on to, when finished. @Note: consider connecting to the notifier(), instead!
@param flags A freely assignable integer, that you can use to identify what the command was all about. Only the RCommandReceiver handling the results will have to know what exactly the flags mean.
