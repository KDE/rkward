This is a helper class to be used in the TwinTable. It represents a column in the table along with the data in it, the data-type and the associated RObject. It comes with functions to read and set data in text format, regardless of how the data is stored internally. It also takes care of allocating memory in chunks, so frequent re-allocations are not necessary.
