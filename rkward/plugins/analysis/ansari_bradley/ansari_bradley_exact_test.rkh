		This test performs the Ansari-Bradley two-sample exact test to test for a difference in scale parameters. This test differs from <link href="rkward://component/ansari_bradley_test"/> in that exact p-values can also be computed in the presence of ties.
	</summary>

	<usage>
		Select two data sets for the Ansari-Bradley two-sample test. For this test the samples need to be numeric vectors (see below for details).
