      This plugin estimates parameters under Item Response Theory approach, using the <link href="rkward://rhelp/ltm-package">ltm</link> package.
    </summary>

    <usage>
      To fit the two parameter logistic model with default settings, just the matrix of manifest variables (dichotomous item responses) must be selected. Further options are described in the sections below.

      The complete results can be stored as a new object in the current workspace for further use (e.g. plotting item characteristic curves).
    </usage>

    <settings>
      <caption id="tab_data"/>
      <setting id="x" title="Matrix of manifest variables">
        Select the matrix of dichotomous item responses from the objects shown on the left.
      </setting>

      <caption id="tab_options"/>
      <setting id="frame_constraints">
        If you want to fix parameters, you have to prepare a matrix of fixed-value constraints first and then select it here. For detailed information on the specific layout of that matrix please refer to the manual for the <link href="rkward://rhelp/ltm">ltm()</link> function.
      </setting>
      <setting id="startval">
        By default start values for the parameters are computed automatically. Alternatively, you can force the use of random start values, or give a matrix of values to be used. For detailed information on the specific layout of that matrix please refer to the manual for the <link href="rkward://rhelp/ltm">ltm()</link> function.
      </setting>
      <setting id="naaction">
        Specifies how missing values are to be treated. By default all available cases are used. If checked, only complete cases will be considered.
      </setting>
      <setting id="irtparam">
        If checked, the coefficients' estimates are reported under the usual Item Response Theory parameterization (which is the default).
      </setting>

      <caption id="tab_advanced_control"/>
      <setting id="iterem" title="Number of EM iterations">
        Defaults to 40.
      </setting>
      <setting id="iterqn_2pl" title="Number of quasi-Newton iterations">
        Defaults to 150.
      </setting>
      <setting id="ghk_2pl" title="Number of Gauss-Hermite quadrature points">
        Defaults to 15.
      </setting>
      <setting id="optimeth" title="Optimization method">
        The default optimization method is BFGS. It can be set to Nelder-Mead, CG, L-BFGS-B, or SANN instead. Please refer to the <link href="rkward://rhelp/optim">optim()</link> manual for details.
      </setting>
      <setting id="verbose">
        Pretty much speaks for itself ;-)
      </setting>
