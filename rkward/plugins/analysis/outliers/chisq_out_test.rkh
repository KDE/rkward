		This test performs a chisquared test for detection of one outlier.
	</summary>

	<usage>
		Chose the data set to find one outlier, based on chisquared distribution of squared differences between data and sample mean. You can chose multiple data. Please consider that this test is no longer recommended. See <link href="rkward://rhelp/chisq.out.test"/>.
	</usage>

		<caption id="tab_variables"/>
		<setting id="x">Select the data to be computed. The vectors need to be numeric, and can be of different length. For the calculation missing values are removed from the data.</setting>
		<caption id="tab_options"/>
		<setting id="opposite">Check if you want not the value with largest difference from the mean, but opposite (lowest, if most suspicious is highest etc.).</setting>
		<setting id="mean">If checked this will calculate you the arithmetic mean is an additional out put. However, this will not effect your results but is just an optional information.</setting>
		<setting id="sd">If checked this will calculate you the standard deviation (regardless of missing values) is an additional out put. However, this will not effect your results but is just an optional information.</setting>
		<setting id="median">If checked this will calculate you the median (regardless of missing values) is an additional out put. However, this will not effect your results but is just an optional information.</setting>
		<setting id="min">If checked this will calculate you the minimum (regardless of missing values) is an additional out put. However, this will not effect your results but is just an optional information.</setting>
		<setting id="max">If checked this will calculate you the maximum (regardless of missing values) is an additional out put. However, this will not effect your results but is just an optional information.</setting>
		<setting id="length">If checked, the length of the data vectors will be shown. However, this will not effect your results but is just an optional information.</setting>
		<setting id="nacount">If checked, and in case of missing values this will show you the number of those. However, this will not effect your results but is just an optional information.</setting>
