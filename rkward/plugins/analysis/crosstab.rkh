	<summary>
Calculate two dimensional contingency tables for the count of occurrences of values in one "dependent" variable crossed with the values in one or more "independent" variables.
	</summary>

	<usage>
Specify the "dependent" variable. This variable will be present in all created tables. Specify one or more "independent" variables. Each of these will be cross-tabulated against the "dependent" variable. "Dependent" and "Independent", here, does not imply any inferential statistics. In each table, the occurrence of combinations of values in the "dependent" and "independent" variable is counted.
	</usage>

		<setting id="x">Select any vector that can be interpreted as a factor. This variable will be present in all tables.</setting>
		<setting id="y">Select one or more vector that can be interpreted as a factor. Each of these will be cross-tabulated against the "dependent" variable.</setting>
		<setting id="chisq">Should a chisquare test be performed (for each pair)?</setting>
