		This test differs from <link href="rkward://component/wilcoxon_test"/> in that it uses a different algorithm and supports the exact test even for tied samples. Please note: The package 'exactRankTests' which was previously used in RKWard is no longer under development. Thus the function wilcox_test from the 'coin' package will be used.

		For details of the implementation see <link href="rkward://rhelp/wilcox_test"/>. For documentation of the dialog settings, see <link href="rkward://component/wilcoxon_test"/>.
