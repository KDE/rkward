		Recode categorical data
	</title>
	<summary>
		Allows you to recode a vector with categorical data. This plugin also allows to recode vectors that are coded numerically, but this only makes
		sense for numeric vectors with only a limited number of unique values.
	</summary>
	<usage>
		Select the vector to recode, and where to store the recoded data. Select the storage mode of the resulting data. Then, on the second tab, specify
		the recodings to make.

		<setting id="old_values">
			For each recoding to perform, first select the old value(s) to recode. This can be either NA/missing, or select non-NA value(s) on the left hand side,
			and add them to the values to be recoded by clicking the arrow-button. If several input values are to be replaced with one output value,
			you can select them all at once.
		</setting>
		<setting id="new_value">
			Enter the new value (or set it to be NA). For factors and character vectors, values will be quoted, automatically.
		</setting>
		<setting id="other">
			Any input values (including NAs) for which no recoding was specified, above, can either be left unchanged ("Copy"), or can be replaced
			with a specific value or NA.
