		<setting id="q">When calculating densities or probabilites, specify one or more quantiles. If this setting is left empty, a sequence of evenly spaced quantiles will be used, instead.</setting>
		<setting id="p">When calculating quantiles, specify one or more probabilities, optionally logarithmic (see below). If this setting is left empty, a sequence sequence of evenly spaced (log) probabilities will be used, instead.</setting>
		<setting id="logp">When calculating probabilities, return these as log (p). When specifying probabilites, these are supplied as log (p).</setting>

		<setting id="lower">If checked (the default) probabilities are P[X â‰¤ x]. Otherwise (upper tail) probabilities are P[X &gt; x]</setting>
