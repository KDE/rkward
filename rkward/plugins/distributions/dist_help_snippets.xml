		<setting id="q">When calculating densities or probabilites, specify one or more quantiles. If this setting is left empty, a sequence of evenly spaced quantiles will be used, instead.</setting>
		<setting id="p">When calculating quantiles, specify one or more probabilities, optionally logarithmic (see below). If this setting is left empty, a sequence sequence of evenly spaced (log) probabilities will be used, instead.</setting>

		<usage>Select the desired mode of operation, then specify the values of interest. The input values (quantiles or probabilies) can be left empty, in which case a short sequence of evenly spaced values will be filled in, automatically.</usage>
