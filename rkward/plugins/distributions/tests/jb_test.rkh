		This plugin calculates a Jarque-Bera chi-squared statistic for a variable x and tests against the null hypothesis of normality
	</summary>

	<usage>
		Select one or more numeric variables to test against normality. An individual test is run for each one of them. The output consists of the JB chi-squared statistic with 2 degrees of freedom and its correspondent p-value.
		
		The statistic's distribution is asynthotic, so this test performs better when working with big samples.

		Make sure the data does not contain NAs, as this will usually prevent the test from succeeding.
	</usage>

	<settings>
		<setting id="x">Select the data to be computed (one or more variables). The vectors need to be numeric and can be of different length. They must not contain NAs.</setting>
		<setting id="length">Select if you want to include the number of observations in the output. (Default: YES)</setting>
