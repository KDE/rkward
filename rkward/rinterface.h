/** This class does the rather low-level interfacing to the R-processor. The
	interface can be used by submitting new commands with issueCommand () (see
	the RCommand-class). Your command will then be placed in a first in first
	out stack of commands to be executed. If you specified a receiver/slot in the
	constructor of the RCommand, you will be notified, when the command has
	finished.

	Note that since communication with R is asynchronous, there is no way to get
	R-output within the same function, the request is submitted. You have to
	provide a callback-slot, if you're interested in the output. (@see RCommand)
