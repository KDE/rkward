/**
This class holds the entries in the menu-bar. Together with RKMenu it is used to identify where dynamically generated entries should go in the menu-hierarchy. I.e. the most important function is to identify, when we try to create a menu with the same id as an already existing one. In this case,
instead of creating a new menu, the old one is returned.

In contrast to RKMenu, the RKMenuList is associated with the menu-bar, not a single menu.
