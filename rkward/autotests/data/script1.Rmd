This is markdown ``{r} .some <- `markdown` `` and this is too, with some `inline(code)`.

Usually, there would be lot of mardown (and this may contain many relevant markers, such as {}, and []).

```{r echo=TRUE}
symb01 <-symb02()
symb03 <- symb04
symb05(symb06); symb07
```

Usually, code chunks shall contain {r}, but we're relaxed about that.

```
symb11 <-symb12()
symb13 <- symb14
symb15(symb16); symb17
```
