/** The baseclass for all RK-plugin-widgets, i.e. widgets, that are used in the
GUI for the plugins. It is mostly used as a skeleton and contains some virtual
functions to be implemented in the respective derived classes.
Note, that although being called a "widget", this class is actually a layout. This
is due to the fact, that most GUI-elements will want to lay themselves out in some
way, most importantly for including labels, but also for some more complex layouting
tasks. It's still called a "widget", because it essentially functions as one.
