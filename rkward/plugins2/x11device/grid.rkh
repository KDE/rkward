	<summary>
		Various parameters for the <b>grid</b>. For detailed description of the individual parameters see the R reference on 'grid'. Note that this works only when standard (traditional S) graphics functions (see library(help="graphics")) are used to construct the plot. This does not work for trellis graphics devices (see <link href="rkward://rhelp/Lattice"/> for some information).
	</summary>
	<usage>
		This may or may not be used as an embeded plugin. When used on a trellis device the produced error message is displayed.

		<setting id="nx">This is the <i>nx</i> argument. The default is NULL, in which case, the vertical lines are drawn at the xaxis ticks. Select None to not draw the vertical lines. Select 'Specify below' to provide a specified (to be specified below) number of vertical lines in the grid.</setting>
		<setting id="nx_cells">This is the <i>nx</i> argument, when 'Specify below' is selected in the above option list.</setting>
		<setting id="ny">This is the <i>ny</i> argument. Similar to <i>nx</i>. See the explanation on number of x cells above.</setting>
		<setting id="ny_cells">This is the <i>ny</i> argument when a specified (by the user) number of y cells are to be used. Similar to x cells.</setting>
		<setting id="custlwd">Check this option to use a custom line width. In which case, provide the width below.</setting>
		<setting id="lwd">This is the <i>lwd</i> argument. Check the above option to use this.</setting>
		<setting id="linetype">This is the <i>lty</i> argument. Choosing Default will not add any arguments to the grid function call, hence the default line type will be used.</setting>
		<setting id="col">This is the <i>col</i> argument. The Default option is similar to that of Line type (see above).</setting>
		<setting id="equilogs">This is the <i>equilogs</i> argument. Uncheck this option to set <i>equilogs=FALSE</i>.</setting>
