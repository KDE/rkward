# loadedNamespaces?! No, namespaces are evil! maybe rename to RKNamespaceObject? No. Let's deal with envirs for now.
# ls (envir=as.environment ("package:base"))
name is base::something

How to deal with those names?
You can't assign like this:
envir::object <- something
Probably it's best not to support assignments outside the .GlobalEnv at all.
It's important to find out, when objects are masked, however. If they are, reading should return a full qualified name. Writing should return a simple name, to allow creation of a masking object in .GlobalEnv

What should be the algorithm?
1) Maybe we should always return the full qualified name.
2) When editing an object in any other env, *first* (suggest to?) make a copy to the .GlobalEnv, and edit that copy
3) Essentially objects in any other environment remain read-only

4) check whether objects are masked, and warn when viewing / editing (only needed for objects outside the global env)
