/** Abstract representation of a variable. A variable in this diction is an RObject, which is a vector of data. It may internally be a factor or a vector.
RKVariables are so far the only type of object that is really editable (data.frames are just a bundle of RKVariables). Therefore, for most practical purposes, the RKVariable represents a column in a table.

TODO: actually, for now, the data is always given to the backend as strings. Change that!
TODO: there should be "chunks" of column-data. This should be done at the level of rows, i.e. across columns. After all, if a row gets added/removed in one column, all other columns of the same table will also be affected.
TODO: which functions should do syncing by themselves, which should not? Or should all set... ()-functions have an extra parameter for this?
