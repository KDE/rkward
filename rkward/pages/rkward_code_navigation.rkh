	<title>Code Navigation</title>
	<summary>
The code navigation feature in script editor windows allows you to navigate R code based on its syntactical structure, e.g. quickly jumping to the next
statement outside the current scope or to the previous top level statement. Several navgation features are deliberately close to debbuggin in R's
<link href="rkward://rhelp/browser">browser()</link>-command, but importantly this works entirely without actually running the code.
	</summary>

	<section title="Available commands" id="commands">
To bring up the code naviagtion mode in script (R or R markdown) window, press the key combination "Meta+n" (shortcut customizable), or select it from the <i>Run</i>-menu. Subsequent single key presses invoke the following actions:

<ul>
	<li><tt><b>n / N</b></tt> Go to the next (n) or previous (N) statement at the current level, or the next outer level</li>
	<li><tt><b>i / I</b></tt> Like n/N, but also step into inner contexts (such as the definition of a function)</li>
	<li><tt><b>o / O</b></tt> Jump directly to the next / previous statement outside the current level (e.g. the first statement after a function body)</li>
	<li><tt><b>t / T</b></tt> Go to the next / previous statement at the topmost level of the script</li>
	<li><tt><b>c / C</b></tt> (For R Markdown documents, only:) Go to the next / previous code chunk</li>
	<li><tt><b>1 / !</b></tt> Go to the top / bottom of the document</li>
	<li><tt><b>s</b></tt> Select the current statement</li>
	<li><tt><b>S</b></tt> (For R Markdown documents, only:) Select add code in the current chunk</li>
	<li><tt><b>Backspace</b></tt> Go back to the position before the latest action.</li>
	<li><tt><b>Esc</b></tt> Exit code navigation mode, and reset the cursor / selection to the state before entering it.</li>
	<li><tt><b>Return</b></tt> Exit code navigation mode, keeping current position/selection.</li>
	<li>Code navigation will also end, if you click anywhere else in the script, switch to a different window, or the script is modified.</li>
</ul>

Finally, you can continue to use regular shortcuts, while in code navigation mode. This includes, importantly:
<ul>
	<li><tt><b>Ctrl+Return</b></tt> Run the current line or selection.</li>
</ul>
	</section>

	<section title="Notes and Tips" id="tips">
The 'n' action is meant to remind of the corresponding step command in the R debugger (see <link href="rkward://rhelp/browser"/>), but it is
not the same. The most important difference being that the code navigation, described here, works on a fully static parsed representation of the script,
and does not attempt to follow control flow, at all.

Further, what exactly is a "statement", and "inner", or and "outer" context may not always be quite clear, and may not always correspond exactly to the way
the R engine sees your code. Instead, these commands are meant to behave in a way, that we hope makes sense, intuitively. Remember to always control, visually, what you are doing, before you hit Ctrl+Enter.

Most commands show a tendency to move towards outer contexts, so 'n' and 'N' are not exact opposites. Remeber you can undo your last step using Backspace, 
if you went past the location you were looking for.
