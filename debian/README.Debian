RKWard for Debian
--------------

RKWard usually ships its own version of the kate syntax-highlighting definition for R. The version shipped by RKWard is - at the time of this writing - better than the own shipped with kate in some respects. Due to packaging conflicts, however, this improved syntax highlighting definition can NOT be included in the rkward package.
You may want to fetch the definition manually from RKWard-CVS and install to /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax/r.xml.
