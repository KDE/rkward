Description: a KDE frontend to the R statistics language
 RKWard aims to become an easy to use, transparent frontend to R,
 a powerful system for statistical computation and graphics.
 Besides a convenient GUI for the most important statistical functions,
 future versions will also provide seamless integration with an
 office-suite.
 .
 RKWard is still in development status. Right now it is most useful as an IDE
 to users with some experience in R, or willing to learn R.
