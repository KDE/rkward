Description: A KDE frontend to the R statistics language
 RKWard is meant to become an easy to use, transparent frontend to the R-language, 
 a very powerful, yet hard-to-get-into scripting-language with a strong focus on 
 statistic functions. It will not only provide a convenient user-interface, 
 however, but also take care of seamless integration with an office-suite. 
 Practical statistics is not just about calculating, after all, but also about 
 documenting and ultimately publishing the results.
 .
 RKWard is still in development status. Right now it is most useful as an IDE to 
 users with some experience in R, or willing to learn R.
