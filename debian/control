Description: a KDE frontend to the R statistics language
 RKWard aims to become an easy to use, transparent frontend to R,
 a powerful system for statistical computation and graphics.
 Besides a convenient GUI for the most important statistical functions,
 future versions will also provide seamless integration with an
 office-suite.
