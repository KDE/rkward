**Everything else**

General:
	- look out for all failed signal/slot connections
	- grep sources for "KDE4"
	- remove all the passing around of KGlobal::config() as a parameter
	- the whole idea of having a single mutex for everything is flawed. We should use several specialized ones

rkcommandeditorwindow
	- polish code completion (e.g. hide window, when there are no completions)
	- placement of menu options?

rkward
	- does closing windows work
	- does updating captions work (when switching windows / window url changes)?

output window
	- does it reload all changed images?

rkworkplaceview
	- does it work?
	- does it have a sunken frame? Can we get rid of that?

rkwindowcatcher
	- does it work?
	- does the "set fixed size" dialog work?
	- does the "copy device to R object" dialog work?

rkfilebrowser
	- does it work?
	- does the completion popup show up in a correct size?

rkloadlibsdialog:
	- does it work?

rkradio:
	- does disabling single options work (in plugins)?

rkdropdown:
	- take care of enabling / disabling single options!

rksettings:
	- check wether settings seem to be saved / loaded correctly
	- are the defaults ok?

data editor:
	- definitely needs better porting
	- does cell painting work ok?

rklocalesupport:
	- does locale switching / detection work? Does Qt have something, yet?

rkspinbox:
	- are all of these fixed? Do some thorough testing
		- does not work in real mode
		- does not update on typed input

rkobjectlistview:
	- do the tool-tips for the objects work?

rkconsole:
	- check whether all selection, editing, navigating really works as expected
	- is tab completion for file names still crashy?
		- currently, problem seems to be inside KUrlCompletion

rkhtmlwindow:
	- when this is open, we always seem to crash on close

rcontrolwindow:
	- this does not really need to be a top-level tool window any more. Since it's rarely used, it might be hidden somewhere.
