**Everything else**

General:
	- look out for all failed signal/slot connections
	- grep sources for "KDE4"
	- remove all the passing around of KGlobal::config() as a parameter
	- the whole idea of having a single mutex for everything is flawed. We should use several specialized ones

rkcommandeditorwindow
	- code completion
		- probably we can trim down the completion widget by providing custom headerData()? (Low priority)
		-* Code completion setup wizard could (looks better that way?) be in either tab or page format
			- Can't do any thing about this. It part of the katepart.
	- placement of menu options?

output window
	- does it reload all changed images?

rkwindowcatcher
	- does the "set fixed size" dialog work?
	- does the "copy device to R object" dialog work?

rkradio:
	- does disabling single options work (in plugins)?

rksettings:
	- are the defaults ok?

rklocalesupport:
	- does locale switching / detection work? Does Qt have something, yet?

rkspinbox:
	- are all of these fixed? Do some thorough testing
		- does not work in real mode
		- does not update on typed input

rkobjectlistview:
	- test everything

rkconsole:
	- check whether all selection, editing, navigating really works as expected
	- is tab completion for file names still crashy?
		- currently, problem seems to be inside KUrlCompletion
	-* one additional newline character printed with every line
		-* function calls, like ls() or getwd() or options("width") still produces an extra new line

rcontrolwindow:
	- this does not really need to be a top-level tool window any more. Since it's rarely used, it might be hidden somewhere.

Wishlist:

	-* notify if r-base-html package is not installed
	-* tooltips for the options on "R-Backend" tab about the internal R-function call
	-* option for a default CRAN mirror, so as not to load the tcl/tk interface everytime
		-* may be have a drop down menu for the available mirrors instead of tcl/tk which can be fetched just once
	-* in administrator mode KdeSudo instead of kdesu or option of both? it is a 'fashion' these days not to have root password (ala *ubuntu)!!
	-* any means of fetching a description of the package before installing?
	- when adding vars to a multi varslot, these should become selected (so you can removed them again with a single click)
