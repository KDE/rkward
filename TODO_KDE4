**Everything else**

General:
	- look out for all failed signal/slot connections
	- grep sources for "KDE4"
	- remove all the passing around of KGlobal::config() as a parameter
	- the whole idea of having a single mutex for everything is flawed. We should use several specialized ones
	-* the 'X' icon for closing a tab (Ctl-W) is absent
	-* when rkward freezes, terminating (window close -> Terminate) rkward does not kill rkward.bin

rkcommandeditorwindow
	- code completion
		- probably we can trim down the completion widget by providing custom headerData()? (Low priority)
		-* completion pop up vanishes on any mouse click - can neither select any completion nor resize the popup
			-* the "Setup" button on the pop up works though
		-* Code completion setup wizard could (looks better that way?) be in either tab or page format
	- placement of menu options?

rkward
	- does closing windows work
		+ seems to..
	- does updating captions work (when switching windows / window url changes)?
		+ seems to..
	-* closing rkward while either the file system or the workspace browser is open, crashes rkward
	-* Import/Export (all plugins?) cause segmentation fault.
		+ much better now.. no seg faults in preliminary testing (10/27/07)
	-* closing the main window before the "R engine is idle" crashes rkward
		-* related to rkhtmlwindow bug?
	-* first time you open the workspace/file-system bowser after starting rkward it does not open properly: opens just enough to be able to drag it open!

output window
	- does it reload all changed images?

 rkworkplaceview
	- does it work?
	- does it have a sunken frame? Can we get rid of that?

rkwindowcatcher
	- does it work?
	- does the "set fixed size" dialog work?
	- does the "copy device to R object" dialog work?

rkfilebrowser
	- does it work? 
		+ seems to..
	- does the completion popup show up in a correct size?
		+ yes, if u mean in the address bar when typing a path
	-* does not work for *.R files
		+ Fixed: works for many (ps/eps/pdf/jpg/png) files now...

rkloadlibsdialog:
	- does it work?

rkradio:
	- does disabling single options work (in plugins)?

rkdropdown:
	- take care of enabling / disabling single options!

rksettings:
	- check wether settings seem to be saved / loaded correctly
	- are the defaults ok?
	-* clicking on "Configure Repositories" button on the Configure Packages dialog 
	   takes you to the "R-Backend" tab on the Settings dialog. Instead it should go 
	   to the "R-Packages" tab.
		+ Fixed, but both "Plugins" and "R-Pacakges" text on the left panel remain selected

data editor:
	- definitely needs better porting
	- does cell painting work ok?
		+ seems to.. on an existing data.frame
	-* entering data freezes rkward

rklocalesupport:
	- does locale switching / detection work? Does Qt have something, yet?

rkspinbox:
	- are all of these fixed? Do some thorough testing
		- does not work in real mode
		- does not update on typed input

rkobjectlistview:
	- do the tool-tips for the objects work?
		-* not quite: tooltip of (i+1)-th object is shown at i-th position

rkconsole:
	- check whether all selection, editing, navigating really works as expected
		-* Shift+End should move the cursor to the end of the line, instead of leaving it at the current position. similarly for SHift+Home
	- is tab completion for file names still crashy?
		- currently, problem seems to be inside KUrlCompletion
	-* one additional newline character printed with every line
		-* function calls, like ls() or getwd() or options("width") still produces an extra new line

rkhtmlwindow:
	- when this is open, we always seem to crash on close
		-* crashes on close even when the Help window is not open

rcontrolwindow:
	- this does not really need to be a top-level tool window any more. Since it's rarely used, it might be hidden somewhere.

Wishlist:

	-* notify if r-base-html package is not installed
	-* tooltips for the options on "R-Backend" tab about the internal R-function call
	-* option for a default CRAN mirror, so as not to load the tcl/tk interface everytime
		-* may be have a drop down menu for the available mirrors instead of tcl/tk which can be fetched just once
	-* in administrator mode KdeSudo instead of kdesu or option of both? it is a 'fashion' these days not to have root password (ala *ubuntu)!!
	-* any means of fetching a description of the package before installing?
