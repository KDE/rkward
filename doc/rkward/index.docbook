You may freely use this template for writing any sort of KDE documentation.

In the future, we may want to change from SGML-based DocBook to XML-based
DocBook. To make this change easier, please be careful :
- in XML, the case of the <tags> and attributes is relevant ;
- also, quote all attributes.

Please don't forget to remove all these comments in your final documentation,
thanks ;-).

<title>Introduction</title>
<para>
&kapp; is meant to be(come) an easy to use graphical frontend to the powerful R language for statistical computing. Since R is a full featured programming language, &kapp; will never be able to offer a complete GUI for everything in R. However, &kapp; strives to make common task simple, to provide an easy entry point for newcomers, while at the same time, transparent access to the full power of the underlying R language is provided for advanced users.

<title>Using &kapp;</title>

<para>
Most documentation is available from inside RKWard itself by selecting Help->Help on RKWard from the Menu, NOT in this document!
</para>
<para>
A useful guide to getting started with &kapp; is <ulink url="http://rkward.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?title=Getting_Started_Using_RKWard">Getting Started Section in the &kapp; wiki</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
Please go there for an introduction to &kapp;, and contact us, if you can help with creating user documentation.

<chapter id="developers">
<title>Developer's Guide to &kapp;</title>

<para>
&kapp; can be extended without the need to recompile using plugins. Extensive documentation on this should be included with &kapp; in docbook format, and is available in HTML format <ulink url="http://rkward.sourceforge.net/documents/devel/plugins/index.html">here</ulink>. (TODO: figure out, how to include this in the docs).

<!-- Use refentries to describe APIs.  Refentries are fairly complicated and you
should consult the docbook reference for further details. The example below was
