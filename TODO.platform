Platform specific TODOs / issues:

Win32:
- The PHP backend is slooooooow
	- Perhaps one more reason to switch the scripting language
- How to build binaries?
- Support for switching to Administrator when installing packages
- KFileDialog-bug (marked TODO in rkward.cpp)
- Termination-bug (marked HACK in main.cpp)

Linux:
- There is a hang when you do
	library (rcdklibs)
- Can we use R_ProcessEvents as well?
