The following list of TODO-items is NOT complete!

stuff to do before 0.2.3 release
- maybe implement simple RObjectViewer
- jump to 0.2.5 on these changes?
- snyc only modified objects!
- add VarType unknown

small stuff to do soon
- instead of keeping state-data for each RObject, use a centralized list of all opened objects and their states in RObjectList?
- merge common functionality of RObjectBrowser and RKVarselector into a base of some sort
- update RKVarselectors on changes in the object-list!
- use a friendly startup-dialog instead of opening an empty table unconditionally
- plugins-scanning: don't duplicate everything
- rework plugin-XML-format
- add more plugin-widgets
- setValue-API for plugin-widgets and copying of values when switching from wizard to dialog-interface
- improve and use debugging framework
- cleanup label-mess for plugin-widgets
- formula-widget:
	- use smart sorting, esp. of generated string
	- add labels, add "up to level" option
	- add constant term option

mid-term stuff
- add XML-parsing helper functions and error-checking
- create a spinbox, that can really deal with real numbers
- create DemonDialogs that notify the user what's going on and potentially request further actions, if an action is to be carried out in the
	R backend that might potentially fail or require user interaction (asynchronously)

stuff to do before the thing is usable
- RKWatch
	- use a cool new RHistory-Widget for the watch
	- discard RCommand-data that is not needed in the history
	- access to (command) editor-settings
	- load / save / spawn as separate editor ...
- add a help-system
- support for multiple tables/data.frames
- mostly everything
- calls from R to RKWard
	- using TCP-sockets?

stuff to do before a 1.0 release
- handle graphics
