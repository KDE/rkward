The following list of TODO-items is NOT complete!

stuff to do before 0.2.7 release
- Object editing / modification tracking:
	- maybe store data directly with objects? Probably not.
	- functions to set double/int/string-vectors directly
- RKEditorDataFrame:
	- allow row deletions
	- find out, why top-left cell gets cleared sometimes

(relatively) small stuff to do soon

- setValue-API for plugin-widgets and copying of values when switching from wizard to dialog-interface
- improve and use debugging framework
- cleanup label-mess for plugin-widgets
- convert plugin-widgets to QWidgets instead of QLayouts
- formula-widget:
	- use smart sorting, esp. of generated string
	- add labels, add "up to level" option
	- add constant term option
- add XML-parsing helper functions and error-checking
- create a spinbox, that can really deal with real numbers
- create agent-dialogs that notify the user what's going on and potentially request further actions, if an action is to be carried out in the
	R backend that might potentially fail or require user interaction (asynchronously)
- UNPROTECT_PTR

stuff to do before the thing is usable
- RKWatch
	- use a cool new RHistory-Widget for the watch
