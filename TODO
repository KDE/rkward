The following list of TODO-items is NOT complete!

stuff to do before 0.2.6 release
- pick some from below:

(relatively) small stuff to do soon
- merge common functionality of RObjectBrowser and RKVarselector into a base of some sort
- update RKVarselectors on changes in the object-list!
- add more plugin-widgets
- setValue-API for plugin-widgets and copying of values when switching from wizard to dialog-interface
- improve and use debugging framework
- cleanup label-mess for plugin-widgets
- formula-widget:
	- use smart sorting, esp. of generated string
	- add labels, add "up to level" option
	- add constant term option
- Object editing / modification tracking:
	- keep pointer to editor with objects instead of modification information
	- maybe make objects assume own responsibility for syncing their data
	- NO, make it much simpler by syncing the data immediately! Delay syncing only during (large) paste operations.
	- maybe store data directly with objects? Probably not.
	- functions to set double/int/string-vectors directly
	- remove objects that are no longer in the workspace from the objectlist
- add XML-parsing helper functions and error-checking
- create a spinbox, that can really deal with real numbers
- create agent-dialogs that notify the user what's going on and potentially request further actions, if an action is to be carried out in the
	R backend that might potentially fail or require user interaction (asynchronously)

stuff to do before the thing is usable
- RKWatch
	- use a cool new RHistory-Widget for the watch
	- maybe keep an (optional) log of RCommands
	- load / save / spawn as separate editor ...
- add a help-system
- support for multiple tables/data.frames
- mostly everything
- calls from R to RKWard
	- using TCP-sockets?

stuff to do before a 1.0 release
- handle graphics
