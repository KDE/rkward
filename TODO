The following list of TODO-items is NOT complete!
Also, plans change frequently. If something is listed for a specific release, that's no more than a rough plan.

stuff to do before 0.2.9 release
- Twintable/RKEditorDataFrame
	- merge the two classes
	- more efficient syncing: fetch only the values actually needed instead of the whole table
	- handle vartype changes
	- rework RKEditorDataFrame::pushTable
- on exit, check whether there are still RCommands left in the backend and wait/request user-interaction before tearing down the thread. After all, the last command might have been a "save"!
- Object editing / modification tracking:
	- functions to set double/int/string-vectors directly. Use in paste-operations
- convert plugin-widgets to QWidgets instead of QLayouts
- error-handling/raising in .rk.do.call
- pick some from below:

(relatively) small stuff to do soon
- add more plugin-widgets
- setValue-API for plugin-widgets and copying of values when switching from wizard to dialog-interface
- improve and use debugging framework
- cleanup label-mess for plugin-widgets
- add component-wrapper and allow embedded plugins
- setEnabled (), setVisible ()-API (trivial, once the plugin-widgets are QWidgets)
- formula-widget:
	- use smart sorting, esp. of generated string
	- add labels, add "up to level" option
	- add constant term option
- add XML-parsing helper functions and error-checking
- create a spinbox, that can really deal with real numbers
- UNPROTECT_PTR
- KDialog::marginHint (), KDialog::spacingHint ()
- give informative feedback on syntax errors (line numbers, etc.)!
- handle insertion of values into factors; value-lables

stuff to do before the thing is usable
- RKWatch
	- use a cool new RHistory-Widget for the watch
	- maybe keep an (optional) log of RCommands
- add a help-system
- add MDI-framework
- mostly everything

stuff to do before a 1.0 release
- handle graphics
