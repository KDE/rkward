The following list of TODO-items is NOT complete!
Also, plans change frequently. If something is listed for a specific release, that's no more than a rough plan.

Little annoying stuff:
- fix flickering when one uses arrows in the console
- auto refresh output + auto scroll at the bottom
- add an example to show rkward-specific commands (rk.print, rk.graph)
- instead of delete RObject, call RObject::deleteThis () and check for deleted in rCommandDone ()?
- use include "x.moc" in order to speed up build

stuff to do before 0.3.2 release
- plugins (general)
	- rework structure (directory layout) of plugin definitions
	- add import-filter plugins
	- add component-wrapper and allow embedded plugins
	- add preliminary image generation
- on exit, check whether there are still RCommands left in the backend and wait/request user-interaction before tearing down the thread. After all, the last command might have been a "save"!
- error-handling/raising in .rk.do.call
- pick some from below:

code cleanups
- I've changed the simple RInterface::issueCommand (QString, ...) command to return a pointer to the RCommand created. This will allow for lots of small cleanups. Do them.
	- well, on second thought, it might be better to rely more on RCommand::id () instead of pointers. Why? The id is unique (until integer overflow). The pointer may be reused after a delete -> potential problem when trying to cancel command which is actually already deleted (and potentially other cases)
	- let's set this back for a while

API documentation:
- add page containing a rough overview of general architecture
- include protected (and maybe even private) members in API-documentation (this is not a library, after all)
- RCommandStack

(relatively) small stuff to do soon
- Twintable/RKEditorDataFrame
	- merge the two classes
	- more efficient syncing: fetch only the values actually needed instead of the whole table
	- make configurable:
		- invalid color (global and per variable)
		- unused color (global and per variable)
		- default alignment (per var type)
		- default precision
		- display of factor level labels (global and per variable)
		- delay of factor-level popup
	- highlighting of value ranges
- Object editing / modification tracking:
	- functions to set double/int/string-vectors directly. Use in paste-operations
- RKVariable:
	- use QIntDict instead of string-map for value-labels / factor levels?
- change EditLabelsDialog to use a small QTable? Probably a lot easier / straightforward to use
- plugins (general)
	- add more plugin-widgets
	- setValue-API for plugin-widgets and copying of values when switching from wizard to dialog-interface
	- improve and use debugging framework
	- cleanup label-mess for plugin-widgets
	- setEnabled (), setVisible ()-API (trivial, once the plugin-widgets are QWidgets)
	- add XML-parsing helper functions and error-checking
- formula-widget:
	- use smart sorting, esp. of generated string
	- add labels, add "up to level" option
	- add constant term option
- create a spinbox, that can really deal with real numbers
- UNPROTECT_PTR
- use RKGlobals::marginHint (), RKGlobals::spacingHint () everywhere
- give informative feedback on syntax errors (line numbers, etc.)!

stuff to do before the thing is usable
- RKWatch
	- use a cool new RHistory-Widget for the watch
	- maybe keep an (optional) log of RCommands
- add a help-system
- mostly everything

stuff to do before a 1.0 release
- handle graphics

Notes for x11-window capturing:
- Plan A:
	- initialization function seems to be in_do_X11
	- it might be possible to put a wrapper around this using R_setX11Routines
	- this wrapper could watch the list of devices (curDevice, numDevices), see also addDevice to find out how the list is kept internally
	- if a new device gets added grab its winId and capture (using QXEmbed?)!
- Plan B:
	- it looks like there's no way to get acces to R_setX11Routines or at least the needed struct R_X11Routines. (?)
	- the level above that seems to be do_X11
	- maybe we can modify the mapping from .Internal (X11) to do_X11 and insert wrapper from Plan A -> R_FunTab
	- proceed like in Plan A
	- less preferable as C-plugins might be able to call do_X11 directly (can they?)
- Plan C:
	- modify at R level (override x11 ())
	- least preferable solution as we can not be sure we catch every use.
