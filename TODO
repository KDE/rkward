The following list of TODO-items is NOT complete!
Also, plans change frequently. If something is listed for a specific release, that's no more than a rough plan.
All in all, this TODO list is mostly for internal purposes, and many parts may not necessarily be intellegible to anybody but the authors.

- Advertizing:
	- start being a bit bolder about RKWard (descriptions, startup notification, etc.)

REmbedInternal:
	- probably we do not need na_double at all (just any NaN) => less confusion

Some items I'd like to get done for 0.3.7 or whatever the next release is going to be called, if they don't take too long:
- RKEditorDataFrame
	- undo/redo
	- deletion of multiple columns in one step
	- when pasting a large array, rows should not be added one by one. Suggested algorithm:
		- if we find out we've already pasted 100 rows, first check, how many more are to come and add this many both to the variable and to the R workspace. Can potentially avoid *lots* of work
- Rework package management dialog
	- use install.packages () to handle dependencies
	- manage R library locations, install to location with user write access
	- the UI should probably be simplified somehow. But how? All in a single list with "filter"? Ask for ideas/look at other apps
- Create an editor for single vectors/factors, or rework RKEditorDataFrame to handle those as well
- RObjectListView
	- use icons to mark up the different base types
- David's usability items
Optional stuff, that could possibly be attacked for 0.3.7:
- RExpressionObject as an abstraction for R-Expressions (i.e. manually edited expressions).
	- It will be possible to "store" these in the RObjectList and select them just like any other object
	- RKVarslot will allow editing the selected value by hand (or just typing the name in)
		- How to do this nicely UI wise?
- RFunctionObject for user defined functions. Maybe later it will be possible to use for functions from packages as well
	- would be nice, if it also had some knowledge about function arguments
	- ideally it would also know about the type of the return value, but this may not be realistic
Timeframe for 0.3.7 release:
- It would be good, if we're at a releasable state within one month from now (i.e. mid May).
	- if reasonably possible, I think we should release then, even if some of the desired features are still missing

- for (i in 1:10){ cat(i,'\t');Sys.sleep(0.05)} results in extra linebreaks in both console and log.
- use SVG device for graphics output
	- provide context menu / other UI to export to different formats / edit
- hot-key/permanent icon to cancel current command / hold processing. Perhaps in the busy/idle indicator?
- frequent output of a command should not raise the command log over and over again (user should have a chance to switch away)

RObjectTables sounds highly interesing. Maybe we can use a transparent table to find out about assignments?
	- Problem: we can't add this on top of the globalenv () (or at least we're not supposed to)
		- can we dare to replace R_GlobalEnv with a fake environment which redirects to the real thing?
R_MakeActiveBinding sounds even more interesting. Maybe we can use this to "watch" symbols?!?
	- can't track removal or creation of new objects this way
	- seems to work only for top-level objects (elements in a list are not discernable, though we do catch the access to the list itself)

Little annoying stuff:
- hide tabs in console
- add an example to show rkward-specific commands (rk.print, rk.graph)
- instead of delete RObject, call RObject::deleteThis () and check for deleted in rCommandDone ()?
- use more QDicts instead of QMap<QString,...>s
- use R_DirtyImage to determine, whether workspace needs to be saved
- in REmbedInternal, add extractTemporaryStrings (), for strings that do not have to be copied
- find out how to save toolbar states properly in parts-GUI
- use constBegin (), constEnd ()
- get rid of all the superflous dependencies: http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00439.html

PHP-backend:
- switch to KProcIO for easier logic
- http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php seems to be faster than eval
- find out why an error in the backend often leads to a subsequent crash

- on viewDeactivated, it may not be safe to call setCaption and there activeWindow (). Apparently, the pointer may be invalid:
	- start rkward with empty table. open command editor. switch back to table. Edit some stuff in the table. Ctrl+W. Crash

Configuration options to add:
	- additional console options:
		- color highlighting for warnings/errors (once we can identify them reliably)
	- additional R engine options:
		- stack size (commandline arg --map-ppsize)
		- disable html help
	- new dataeditor options:
		- see below: comments on RKEditorDataFrame

RKHelpDlg:
	- in the mid term, this should probably be renamed and moved to windows
	- call .rk.get.installed.packages, and update package selection drop down on every show, but not on startup

- RKConsole:
	- Console should start a command chain when submitting a batch of pasted commands

RKwatch:
	- optionally keep a file log!

- check whether we're running in a PTY, and warn otherwise. Currently the R backend needs this.

- remove classes/files:
	- RKDocManager? Is this used?
	- RKGlobals
		- static members should be moved to the respective classes. Much cleaner!

stuff to do before 0.4.0 release
- plugins (general)
	- add import-filter plugins
- on exit, check whether there are still RCommands left in the backend and wait/request user-interaction before tearing down the thread. After all, the last command might have been a "save"!
	- How about always doing exiting via a "q ()" command in the backend, instead? That way we could always be sure, all previous commands have been completed before the q ()!
- error-handling/raising in .rk.do.call
- pick some from below:

code cleanups
- I've changed the simple RInterface::issueCommand (QString, ...) command to return a pointer to the RCommand created. This will allow for lots of small cleanups. Do them.
	- well, on second thought, it might be better to rely more on RCommand::id () instead of pointers. Why? The id is unique (until integer overflow). The pointer may be reused after a delete -> potential problem when trying to cancel command which is actually already deleted (and potentially other cases)
	- let's set this back for a while

API documentation:
- add page containing a rough overview of general architecture
- RCommandStack

(relatively) small stuff to do soon
- Twintable/RKEditorDataFrame
	- merge the two classes
	- more efficient syncing: fetch only the values actually needed instead of the whole table
	- make configurable:
		- invalid color (global and per variable)
		- unused color (global and per variable)
		- default alignment (per var type)
		- default precision
		- display of factor level labels (global and per variable)
		- delay of factor-level popup
	- highlighting of value ranges
- Object editing / modification tracking:
	- functions to set double/int/string-vectors directly. Use in paste-operations
- RKVariable:
	- use QIntDict instead of string-map for value-labels / factor levels?
- plugins (general)
	- add more plugin-widgets
- formula-widget:
	- use smart sorting, esp. of generated string
	- add labels, add "up to level" option
	- add constant term option
- create a spinbox, that can really deal with real numbers
- UNPROTECT_PTR
- use RKGlobals::marginHint (), RKGlobals::spacingHint () everywhere
- give informative feedback on syntax errors (line numbers, etc.)!

stuff to do before the thing is usable
- add a help-system
- mostly everything

stuff to do before a 1.0 release
- handle graphics

################## cryptic notes ######################

- printutils.c->481 Rvprintf: can we get at the standard out-connection and give it a fake vprintf (or better write?!) and fake fflush?
	- see also: connections.c line 3246ff InitConnections
	- seems ok now. But maybe we could still use this to catch immediate warning messages (which go to R_Consolefile)?

- still mysterious in warning-handling: 'help (doesnotexist); print ("stuff");'. Why is the order wrong?!

tryCatch (message ("a"), error=function (x) {print ("e"); x$message}, warning=function (y) {print ("w"); conditionMessage(y)}, message=function (z) {print ("m"); conditionCall (z)})
withCallingHandlers ({message ("a"); stop ("b");}, error=function (x) {print ("e"); x$message}, warning=function (y) {print ("w"); conditionMessage(y)}, message=function (z) {print ("c"); conditionCall (z)})

Not quite correct yet:
	.Internal (.addCondHands (c ("error"), list (function (x) {print ("e"); print (conditionMessage (x))}), parent.frame (), NULL, TRUE))

.Internal (.addCondHands (c ("warning"), list (function (x) {print ("w"); print (conditionCall (x))}), globalenv (), NULL, TRUE))

condition handlers seem to be reset after an error!
condition handlers do not seem to carry over two separate calls of R_tryEval ().
