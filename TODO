The following list of TODO-items is NOT complete!

stuff to do before 0.2.8 release
- Object editing / modification tracking:
	- maybe store data directly with objects? Probably not.
	- functions to set double/int/string-vectors directly
- Twintable/RKEditorDataFrame
	- rework type-select cell
	- merge the two classes
- create load-agent
- basic modification tracking:
	- do not ask for save on a workspace that is entirely empty and has seen no user commands (or just one that is entirely empty?)

(relatively) small stuff to do soon

- setValue-API for plugin-widgets and copying of values when switching from wizard to dialog-interface
- improve and use debugging framework
- cleanup label-mess for plugin-widgets
- convert plugin-widgets to QWidgets instead of QLayouts

	- use smart sorting, esp. of generated string
	- add labels, add "up to level" option
	- add constant term option
- add XML-parsing helper functions and error-checking
- create a spinbox, that can really deal with real numbers
- UNPROTECT_PTR
