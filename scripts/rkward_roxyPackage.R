## README
# this R script can be used to let roxyPackage maintain the rkward package sources
# to use it
#  1. install the package "roxyPackage"
#  2. make a local copy of this file
#  3. checkout the lates rkward package sources via svn
#  4. cusomize the first part of the script (see below, you MUST set these paths correctly!)
#  5. run the script

## setup environment
# .libPaths("~/R")
require(roxyPackage)

local({
